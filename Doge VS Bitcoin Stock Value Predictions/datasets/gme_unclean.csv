In Lemon mans latest rant ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEi2axM4hwI&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;ab\_channel=CitronResearch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEi2axM4hwI&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;ab_channel=CitronResearch)) , he says, the only way to ""save gamestop is actually buying something from them"". So I do my research. Mods I am not breaking any rules saying this, do your own research before investing anything.

My idea is all in the PowerupPro subscription. [https://www.gamestop.com/poweruprewards/#gameinformerZone](https://www.gamestop.com/poweruprewards/#gameinformerZone)

Powerup pro is gamestops subscription service. For 15$ a month you get 5$ upfront and 5$ every month for the year. In total this is 65 USD. This is free money, and way less volatile than actual stocks. What you can do with this is wait 1 year, buy a highly sought-after release (ie COD, some game that has market scarcity) from games stop at the midnight release, buy it for 65$ or whatever price it is (even though you yourself have only paid 15$, and you can then either play this new expensive game at a massive discount or, you can go on ebay and make a 300% profit on your investment, all while helping gamestop (only saying this because gamestop is part of my childhood and minor business does not = fluctuations on the open market).

Also for 5$ extra you can get yourself a copy of [Gameinformer.com](https://gameinformer.com/), which is a fucking steal for something to have on your coffee table.

I'd like your input, and again do your own due diligence. This is an investing forum, and this is a great small game which honestly has alot less risk than other stocks priced similarly. Let me know what you think

**GME - The Truth Behind Cramer, The News, Melvin &amp; Shitron (Evidence of my warnings)**

OC[Discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/search?q=flair_name%3A%22Discussion%22&amp;restrict_sr=1)

**TLDR: The whole Citron attack, the news articles, Cramer etc was planned by pissed off hedge-funds (mainly Melvin) who want WSB to appear to be a single, coordinated market manipulating entity - Source: London Hedge Fund PM**

Hi everyone,

Time to finally spill the beans about what's really going on here. WSB deserves to know.

Long-time lurker here. This is a crazy but true story so buckle-up for a wild-ride. Here is evidence of my conversations with the mods, before the Shitron shit went down. Most of the complex, sensitive stuff was explained via signal call with OIP. Numerous emails which would be too long too disclose and also containing sensitive info were exchanged (takes centuries to write this shit out as you can see) but here are the things which I can release. It's very hard to prove everything because it's based on a tip I got from a reliable source and I don't have a recording of my calls with him or OIP, but here's proof I can provide without compromising certain people that I know what I'm talking about:

[OIP confirming on Thursday that my warnings were true and panned out exactly how I said they would](https://imgur.com/a/5TmznIF)

**Storytime:**

Earlier this week (I'm British) I sent an urgent message to the mods via a private channel (truth is if I put the full details of that screenshot some people involved who may be reading this will figure out the source potentially) warning them about information I received from a hedge fund trader at a boutique British fund who happens to be in the know about a lot of things going on behind the scenes in the market (he has friends in the SEC from his time in NYC) . I contacted the mods as fast as possible, I warned of a ridiculous conspiracy, some shit uncovered that was ridiculously crazy and that the mods had to know urgently. I gave them my encrypted email and phone. I got on a Signal call with OIP for some time, but also talked to Bacon Futures and [u/zjz](https://www.reddit.com/u/zjz/) about this situation. Everything I told them panned out, in the specific ways I said (I didn't know it would be Citron tweeting, but I knew and told OIP that some unexpected people with weight and attention would get involved very soon and take on WSB head-on). Initially I was treated like a jokeman and a crazy conspiracy theorist but zjz and Bacon both came around in the end. The 3 mods I have referred to will hopefully confirm in the comment section below that I indeed did warn ahead of these events unfolding.

**But anyways, it's time you guys hear what my source had to say:**

He warned that there were many more hedge funds involved with the naked short-selling of GME and that the recent short/gamma squeeze had really pissed off quite a few people who were now faced with the prospects of huge losses on their books. Ever since WSB was covered by Luke Kawa on Bloomberg, firms have been keeping an eye on the sub. But this was the final straw, when retail investors just fucked over the institutions who are so used to manipulating markets the way they want through illegal practices such as naked short-selling. They were pissed off, royally, and finally decided to do something about the growing retail investor base (WSB) who were making money too easily, and that too at their expense.

Their plan is simple.

&amp;#x200B;

1. **First of all, get the finance world to start covering WSB again heavily. Notice how there wasn't much coverage before of all the crazy things people on this sub have bought and how far they went up?** But recently, everyone's focused on WSB. They have to push the narrative that we are out-of-control retail investors (Brits like me who use CFDs are exempt lol) who are an institution, a solid group, manipulating markets. This turns the public perception of WSB, what is a retarded forum famous for both immense gain and loss porn, into a group of highly coordinated manipulators fueled by nothing but short-term greed. **Barrons, Cramer, Seeking Alpha, Business Insider, Bloomberg, Wall Street Journal, Marketwatch, even VICE FUCKING NEWS** etc everyone's on us. Never had this much coverage. It's all paid jobs coordinated across the media to draw attention to this. It's also to draw attention away from the fact that they engaged in naked short-selling and that's a key reason why the squeeze has been so hard.  
 
2. **Collude together to get someone who is considered a heavyweight to intervene and take on the WSB head on, explicitly.** I told OIP on Monday that there were much bigger fish involved in this and that we'd rattled the hornet's nest and that my source didn't want to give me a name but he said they were well-known short-sellers. He said their goal was to act as the public muscle on behalf of Melvin (remember how he sucked Melvin off completely during the video?) and others with an unexpected entrance (to spice things up and again draw public attention) and paint a straw-man of Reddit traders being the sole force behind GME going up (and not a combination of Cohen coming in, general turnaround buying, naked-short selling squeeze as well as options gamma squeeze from WSB). Not only does the market listen to Citron in general, so some puts can finally go in-the-money (notice how the expiry of the contracts is tomorrow?), but it draws huge attention. **Their sole intention is to villify and demonise retail investors, and to squeeze every penny out of us as they can like they normally do**. The whole situation doesn't make sense from a logical point of view... Why would **Citron enter out of nowhere, shill for Melvin, consistently repeat that GME is going to $20, postpone their speech for ""inauguration"", get ""hacked by too many people"" and then a mysterious person buys puts at the same time as the announcement?**  
 

The whole markets are watching now, Institutions vs Retail. Citron takes on all GME buyers. Surprisingly enough, having told OIP explicitly that we should not act like a coordinated group with the GME pushing unless we want something crazy to unfold (OIP passed the message to the senior mods), the very next day WSB makes a twitter account with inflammatory comments like ""**We are a force to be reckoned with"" ""We are taking over"" ""It's time for us to have a voice""**. My source told me weirdly enough ahead of time that there would be some form of public contact/calling out between short-sellers and WSB. **He literally said their tactic was to draw WSB out explicitly, paint us as a collective single entity which coordinates trades and turn the public sentiment against us**. I literally told this to OIP exactly on the call, that the hedge-fund muscle (didn't know it was fucking Shitron then) were going to come out and attack WSB for the first time directly as a bunch of clueless traders and suckers. **Literally, everything unwound almost exactly as my source claimed they would**. This started happening slowly before but I only got the tip now about the full story. They were bleeding before, they got their buddy Cramer (who's admitted to openly manipulating markets) to push for a GME stock offering to give those gay shorts liquidity. ""Shore up the balance sheet"" and some BS. Constantly moving from side to side. The whole thing is completely off. As I consistently said to the mods in my messages (images), the twitter account plays right into their hands and it's basically doing their job for them. You couldn't get more explicit than saying that you're ""**taking over""** a market and a ""**force to be reckoned with""**. We couldn't be more explicit in trying to get the SEC to investigate the subreddit. Even if we did control the stock market, the worst thing you can do is write these things out explicitly on Twitter where the SEC are known (Hi Papa Elon) to be fucking strict.

**My opinion**: Getting retail investors out of the game has been a goal of the financial establishment for some time. They cannot fathom that what was once a big boys only table has now been democratised into any autist with $100 can buy options and make money. Meme stocks made more money than the hedge funds last year. They want us out of the game. It's that simple. But don't worry, they'll probably put restrictions in the name of ""protecting unsophisticated retail investors from volatility"". They'll ban your options without owning the underlying (but keep an exception for authorised financial institutions) just like they lobbied to class CFDs as swaps and keep them out of US retail's hands (freedom my arse). Pattern day trader rules, hello? **In the future something is probably going to seriously wrong, and they'll pin it on ""the uneducated retail investors"".**

To preserve the future of this sub, we must not act like or even entertain the idea that we are an institution. Deepfuckingvalue made a really good call, and kudos to him. **But the whole GME situation has gone too far, and you know it has when Cramer, Shitron, Melvin and a ton of major news outlets are all hammering on about WSB and GME**. **Not acting like an institution extends to not having a Twitter account which ""speaks on behalf of WSB""**. There's bull gang, bear gang, cash gang, theta gang etc etc.

Fellow autists, I hope you can see this. As for the lead mods, please heed my warnings. As fun as it is crushing the institutions, they have much more power then us retail investors. The SEC itself was founded by a fucking insider trader. **Only 1 person went to jail for the financial crisis but they sent a WSBer to jail for filing a false acquisition offer for Fitbit**. The game is rigged, always has been. Stick to meme stocks, go back to inversing each other to see who wins. Or post diamond in the rough DD which WSB is famed for. Thanks.

High profiles do not help anyone, and it leads to things like this happening which threaten the very existence of our sub. **We may win the battle, but we will most definitely lose the war against these corrupt entities who bribe politicians to get bailed out when they fuck up, make laws to ruin their competition, manipulate markets for their own gain and have a chummy, revolving door with the SEC.**

Citron, Cramer, Melvin. Fuck you. You guys are the true scum of the earth. I don't care that you're short GME, I care that you're taking part in collusion, market manipulation via naked shorting, and the intentional villification of small time day traders.

Just like in 2008, you're coming up with bullshit and trying to sell it as AAA. Just like you villified the poor people and immigrants for taking home loans instead of the people like yourselves who committed securities fraud, you're villifying the small retail trader trying to make some money in a period of massive job losses whilst you continue to manipulate markets as you've done for decades and keep minting money.

This is **blasphemy**. On E-Trade right now its literally **impossible** to short the stock (no shares available, check picture). E-Trade is one of the largest trading platforms in the world!

And when you were able to short the stock the borrow rates were **astronomical**..... not ""average"" as he suggests.... I have posted proof of that as well (I was short GME for a while. Gay bear I know). He paints a picture as if these huge hedge funds are short GME and willing to wait it out for months for their ""thesis"" to prove true. I also believe this is false.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hgcbhjdh0uc61.png?width=1491&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87c38c9160f110330fc35d7aa710911923c7296b

**The scary thing about short positions is when they move against you is the get larger.** What starts out as a $10million dollar bet against Gamestop at $5 share price is now a $100million dollar bet if the stock price hits $50. Also consider that many of these funds were probably doubling down as the stock ran up. See how a position that was maybe 1% of your portfolio can quickly become 20% or even more.

What Andrew doesn't want to admit is some of these big funds are holding **massive** bags. I guarantee you it's getting to the point where the juice is no longer worth the squeeze. Shares are getting called back, margin terms are changing (it happened at E-trade), and firms are paying super high interest rates just to hold their position. Not to mention this is happening in the middle of a crazy bull run. Do fund managers really want to continue holding this position when so much other stuff is hitting all time highs?

Basically what fund managers are beginning to be say to themselves is something along the lines of ""**the markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.""** Frankly the original thesis doesn't even matter anymore. What matters is the stock is up nearly 1000% in the last 6 months and their short position has become so large that it's a massive liability. They aren't stupid. They a gamma  squeeze could send this thing to $1,000.

What I'm saying is that investors are applying so much pressure that they're going to break. The thesis of the company changed when Ryan Cohen came on board. That's when you saw institutional **smart/big** money get on the long side. The companies who are short want to get out of their positions but they don't want to cover at this price. They desperately want the stock to dip to $20 so they can exit their positions without a MTD portfolio loss of double digits. Remember that the people making these decisions got there because they were almost always **correct**. They are feeling the pressure. One bad trade can unravel everything you've worked for in wallstreet.

**What This Means**: Buy as many shares as you can and hold no matter what. As long as we don't sell we will avoid a massive sell-off. Their aren't enough shares available to short for them to drive down the price artificially.

l2uasj,stoney-the-tiger,2021-01-22 18:54:03,GME,"TL;DR;  Let the bears off the hook if they pay everyone $420.69/share (or some negotiated price).

I was thinking that it might be good to have a different way for this to end. Below are the goals that I had in mind for an amicable ending to this situation and a proposed framework to reach that goal.

# Goals

* Enhance GME’s financial stability
* Provide capital for execution of strategic growth plan
* Provide an ownership structure supportive of the growth plan
* Ensure no retail investor is a bag holder
   * i.e. Some that made $1000/share and some that missed the squeeze and only made have $100/share post squeeze
* Stabilize volatility in the stock
* Distribute the short squeeze spoils to shareholders more tax efficiently than a short term capital gains windfall
* Offer the bears a (painful but acceptable) exit strategy
   * We cannot kill them or beat them within an inch of their life or they will never agree.  This is kind of like a reverse bankruptcy or setting them up on a payment plan

# Mechanism

Have a shareholder vote at the 2021 Gamestop Annual Meeting (June 2021), to offer the following capital raise and exit for bears.

* Shorts pay Gamestop $420.69 for every Class A share that is shorted to create the missing shares and settle any outstanding short interest
   * Gamestop fulfills any phantom shares to investors who have been sold a phantom share by a short.
   * Gamestop retires any phantom shares that were held by a short to minimize the expansion of Class A shares
* Gamestop creates a Class C with no voting rights (similar to Alphabet or Zillow Group)
   * This will ensure supportive RC has a lot of room to maneuver on strategic execution
   * This will make it easier to do subsequent equity raises for growth
* Gamestop uses the $420.69/share to create a fund for a special dividend for Class A shareholders
   * Special dividend will be paid out $21 quarterly over 5 years
   * The first dividend will actually take the form of 1 share of Class C stock for each share of class A
      * GME keeps this as a \~1.4-1.5 Billion cash from an equity raise which will stabilize the company’s financials
   * 19 payments of $21 to each Class A shareholder will then proceed
   * If the bears cannot afford this upfront, they can be put on a payment plan
   * Bears can contain their losses at \~30 Billion and move on
* Bears have 60 days to accept these terms or else the price for the offer goes up by $10/share/month

My Position: 1685 shares, 5 16C 4/16

l37qjw,MailNurse,2021-01-23 07:33:09,GME,"As I stay up late tonight, reminiscing on the crazy fucking week I just experienced, listening to the tendie man on repeat, I recall seeing everywhere people being downvoted and shamed for selling GME shares after green Friday. I’ve come to some conclusions.
I’ll start by saying, if you did sell, 1) you’re kind of retarded, but then again we all are, you just are more. 2) you can still buy and make gains, just don’t let emotion influence your trades. Look at what happened today and decide if you could’ve made more if you held, make this a learning experience 3) don’t brag about your pussy retard move by posting about selling a stock when it hurts investors who have invested savings and the company we want to see succeed so much. If you do it, you’re letting the devil win (AKA Andrew Left). 
My next point is that when people do sell GME, which is expected for any stock (stocks can some time go down before they go up people), it allows a cheaper price to buy in at and therefore even higher gains once the bigger and the biggest gains come. 
Also, what do you think will happen when GME hits 1000$? People will continue to hold? No. People believe in GME, I believe in GME, but there will be selloffs in the low hundreds, at that point we all buy back in and this shit either repeats or everyone moves on to NOK or BB. The main message here is don’t be a pussy and buy the dip faggot. 
My last point is, it’s their money. They earned it by stealing their moms credit card and buying stocks on Robinhood like all of us. If they want to sell, I’ll be there to pick it up, and when they get FOMO, they’ll buy in at a higher price from someone who did what they originally did. It’s a circle of life, but we have to live in harmony. Like I said, if you do sell GME, don’t post it in WSB, on twitter or on r/GME. You never know if your post could be the cascade. 
Today during the fall from $80 to $50 I was very nervous. I let my emotions get the best of me during the spike and bought more shares at 70$. I was really considering selling all, but now it looks like Monday, 70$ is gonna be what market will be at around 10 am. No one had said anything during the circuit breaker. I grew some diamond encrusted nuts and said here and WSB (which got me 1 day ban because the mods suck cock) in a post, “DO NOT SELL”. I refreshed and there were ten other people just like me. We are holding gentlemen. DDAY has just started, and Berlin is far from where we are. Give tendie man a listen if you’re ever down, don’t get emotional trading next week, and don’t forget to buy the dips and hold the line, lots of news will be posting negatively about GME, people will tell you to sell, all I have to say is nothing has changed, hold your ground, and may the tendies rain. 

TL; DR:
- It’s their money
- You buy the shares they sell at a lower price (buying the dip faggot)
- They’re the ones who miss out

- don’t get emotional trading 
- you shouldn’t sell
- communication with other traders during the day is important 
- GME 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀",Why you shouldn’t be mad at people who sell
l387x2,Unhappy-Albatross-67,2021-01-23 08:12:51,GME,,Is there any awards for being dumb? I literally sell my GME three days ago at 37$ do u guys think it’s getting higher?
l38tw3,jackietsaah,2021-01-23 09:04:02,GME,"Evening everyone! I’m going to present to you an alternative to buying shares, which is much more capital friendly, effectively a leveraged position, and results in similar price movements.

The trick: deep in the money call, typically dated a bit farther out, aka the LEAPS. If you’re not familiar with those, I do encourage you to learn a bit about them on YouTube (Kamikaze Cash, for instance), especially if you don’t know anything about options in general.

With deep ITM calls, you pay mostly for intrinsic value, so the options are **very little** susceptible to IV crush and theta decay, and since they are soo deep in the money, their “delta” is very close to 1. 

If your’re not familiar with options greeks, the delta is how much an option’s value moves when stock moves by $1. One share is basically 1 delta, obviously.

Take $30c 7/16, for example, going for $38.22 at close, when GME was $65. Notice that break even is just $68.22 ($30 strike + $38.22 premium) which means that only $3.22 is the extrinsic value, which can decay, all the rest is intrinsic value and this call’s delta is about 91%. Also, if GME moves just by over 4.9% by July, your call is profitable. 

Here are two scenarios, to compare:
1. You buy 100 shares at $65, you invested $6500 and if GME goes to $130 and doubles, you made $6500 or 100% of profit.
2. You buy $30c 7/16. Market Maker buys 91 shares to hedge (because delta is 0.91). You invested $3800 dollars. If GME goes to $130, your call will have appreciated by $65 x 0.91 = $59.15, to $97.15. While you’ve made a slightly smaller lump sum, you have earned 155% in #2 vs. 100% in #1, and you used only 2/3 of capital. 

So, instead of buying 200 shares and thus creating 200 delta, you could have bought 3 such calls, for 270 delta (or the number of shares a MM would have to buy to hedge).

So, to summarize:
* your net effect on the share price is similar to buying 100 shares, because delta is close to 1 and MMs buy shares to hedge when they sell calls
* Much more capital friendly, you get a lot more delta per dollar invested
* Much higher profits, in percents, for the same absolute stock movement, because your initial investment is much less.

Downsides? Well, your profits move much more quickly, but so do your losses, and this is a call, after all, so you do risk losing it all if GME falls below the strike. However, your losses are capped at the premium you paid, vs. the total share price when you buy shares. 

Do feel free to cross-post to WSB, because I’m temporarily banned there. :(","If you can’t afford 100 shares, buy deep ITM calls (LEAPS)"

GME Infinite Gamma Squeeze | Gap In Option Market Structure | Once In a Lifetime Opportunity

Context

What happened last week with GME stock price and option was a combination of a gamma squeeze [1] and infinite short squeeze [2]. For the first time in financial history all GME call options are in the money (ITM) because the highest call strike price set by the CBOE for Januaray 29, 2021 is $60.

Note: A primer on gamma squeeze:

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2t9bf/gme_i_think_this_is_a_gamma_squeeze_where_dealers/

Market Maker [1] are in a condition never observed in financial history. Hundred of thousands of retail (wsb) are buying the GME 60C across the options calendar and MM can't hedge properly because there are not enough GME shares to buy to properly financially hedge (accounting for the interest rate to borrow)

Market Structure

To summarize the market structure:

1.	⁠Few GME shares to hedge.
2.	⁠Hundreds of thousands of (wsb) are buying the GME 60C because of the infinite short squeeze.
3.	⁠January 29, 2021 60C call option are the highest one on the option change for that date.
4.	⁠Conditions for Infinite Gamma Squeeze &amp; Infinite Short Squeeze

As you may now realize --(MM and brokers) hope you don't -- there is a gap in the market structure that leaves them (MM/Citadel) vulnerable to massive losses.

Infinite Gamma Squeeze

Should million of retails (wsb) buy the Januray 29, 2021 60C weekly on Monday, this will create an infinite gamma squeeze because MM still can't properly hedge, and are forced to buy shares at whatever price to hedge. MM doing so, forces brokers to margin call the shorts caught in their infinite short squeeze. Both conditions are pro-cyclical and feed on each other in an infinite feedback loop so long as more an more retails buy the GME 60C.

There is a chance that MM can dump the shares they bought to hedged the gamma steepening and call buying [1]. However, doing so does not make them market neutral. It effectively turns MM into a hedge fund. SEC may allow them to get away from this momentarily.

However, after the MM dump shares in an attempt to stop the infinite gamma squeeze they will be net short GME shares and unhedged/not market neutral. If after the MM dump, retails continue to buy GME shares up to the $60 price, MM will be caught in a exponentially worse gamma squeeze, which should GME go pass 60C (gamma bump) on the week of January 25, it would turn into the one of biggest tail risk event for the MM/Citidal.

tldr;

There is a gap in the market structure so that if millions of retails buy Januray 29 GME 60C on January 25 2021, there is a high probability of both an infinite gamma and short squeeze. This has never happened in financial history. And should millions of retail buy the January 29 GME60C 2021, the losses for MM but profits for retail will be massive. Retails could see 100000% return on their weekly GME Januray 29 call options at the highest strike price.

Edit1: Apparently there may be higher call prices for the January 29 2021 option chains. Fundamentally, this analysis is still correct. Should millions of retail all choose a common higher call strike price to buy (higher than 60C), the gamma squeeze will be triggered when that prices is hit.

Example:

Should millions of retail buy the January 29 70C or January 29 75C, and the infinite short squeeze continues. If the GME 70C or 75C is hit, GME share price enters a gamma squeeze.

What the MM are hoping for are twofolds:

1.	⁠They scare retails to sell below $60. This alleviates the infinite gamma squeeze. Or;
2.	⁠Retails don't all buy the same call options. But given that wsb loves high risk, I hypothesize they will all choose the furthest OTM call options.

GME at 60 is the Maginot line next week. Should it go to 75, gamma and infinite short squeeze continues. Should it fall below it, MM have won a strategic victory.

Edit2:

For gamma squeeze, you look at the open interest (OI) and strike price. Should the share price get close to the price with a highest open interest, that's when the gamma steepening occurs as probability goes to 1. MM have to buy shares to remain neutral as the options are now ITM.

l3kqnp,lastonegotband,2021-01-23 21:15:38,GME,"I'm likely a good deal older than most of the ""19 year old degenerates"" on this subreddit (I'm 35). 

Last January things were going pretty good. I had a job, I was engaged to be married, and I had finally felt like an ""adult.""

Then COVID hit, taking everything down. I was put on furlough and then cut from work. The government gave me back my $600--yipee--and told me to fuck off. Meanwhile, after a brief blip, Wall Street bounced back, reaching record highs, making back everything they lost, and then some.

It's a funny thing, because I've seen this movie before. It was called the ""Global Financial Crisis."" Back then, they blamed a worldwide economic collapse on people overleveraging into debt. Not the banks and lenders handing out that debt like candy, of course--the people who didn't know any better and trusted what they were told were to blame for accepting all the rotten loans. I was 21 then, just out of college, and had difficulty finding work. And after the shit hit the fan, it was the banks which were bailed out, not the people. There was a whole fucking movement around this--Occupy Wall Street--that had some good ideas but ultimately went nowhere.

So now I'm sitting back, watching the GME story after a horrific 2020. After the GFC, there were laws put into place to heavily restrict blatant short selling. There were guard rails, in other words, to make sure nothing disastrous could occur in the pReCiOuS mArKeTs. Those EXACT laws are what Melvin et all are breaking in their egregious and idiotic short selling of GME. (How the HELL do you short more shares than are available?) And look at all the articles coming out once again: it's \*our\* fault GME is so volatile. We're causing all this price action, somehow outsmarting billionaire hedges for lulz. We're the reckless and insane ones.

Everyone mentions Michael Burry but no one talks about Mark Baum aka Steve Eisman aka Steve Carrell's character. The events in his specific life were largely fictionalized in The Big Short, but the fact is he had big ""fuck corruption"" energy in the film, and that's largely what motivated him to bet against CDOs.

So you're telling me for the low low price of $60 I can buy a few shares, join in unity with others who are struggling and never got help, make the funds performing illegal activity bleed a billion a week, \*and\* make a few bucks doing it? Hell yes, I'm in GME gang.

What all these articles and funds don't understand is we're not doing this because it's ""fun"" or because we're a hive mind or because we think we are trading gurus. We're doing it because we have no other options left. We're doing it because we want a crack at getting out of the chains YOU put us in. Fuck you. You'll keep trying to scare us, but we don't care, because all we have to do is smile and wait, while every day that passes and dollar that rises causes you pain.

Hold the line, everyone. We're going to $1,000. The squeeze has yet to squoze.

TL;DR at the bottom.

Recently, MrBeast  bought out 5 GameStop stores and all the merchandise/stock they had available only to give it away as [his YouTube content](https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/mrbeast-spends-insane-amount-buying-out-five-stores-just-to-give-it-all-away-1492607/).

We all know there's a historical scale short squeeze coming soon which will cause a legendary redistribution of wealth.

We all know 🌈🐻 are fucked with something they've never been penetrated by.

We are all buying shares at any given price like rabid investors &amp; 💎🙌.

I sold my 1/29 calls way too early Friday and bought shares almost at the top at $68 and will be buying WAY more shares come Monday 1/25.

And let this post be another one of my commitment to this historical movement.

When GME ever closes above $690 for one single day, I will be buying out one entire GameStop store and donate most of the merchandise to a charity and make **#GameStopChallenge** trending.

This in effect will achieve 5 great things:

1. Help boost GameStop sales.
2. Potentially save a closing store by: a. helping the sales of that one location &amp; b. by giving it enough public attention and keeping its flow and foot traffic steady for months with a potential media/news coverage.
3. Returning favor to society and community.
4. Potentially start a movement which will be followed by my other autists in this sub and looping effects 1 \~ 3 above.
5. Giving WSB a good reputation, positive media coverage, and helping the community grow and mature into something net neutral or positive.

Disclaimer: No I'm not a influencer or any kind of internet celebrity and no I don't have a YouTube channel that I wish to create, shill, and grow. This is purely for the meme spirit.

P.S. $690 is just an arbitrary number and will not sell below $1000.

**TL;DR: I buy everything in one GameStop when GME close $690.**

You can get $10 Amazon gift cards for $5 a month. 
If you and your partner have an account each, you can get 2x$10 gift cards for only $10 a month. 


You can do this for any gift card on the wall, with the exception of Visa (because that’s considered money laundering).

Yes

Amazon? Yes

Restaurants? Yes

Apple? Yes

3. Ability to articulate and demonstrate the benefits of said membership in a concise but easy to follow understandable format.

4. Math expertise to breakdown the ROI for others.

FIrst of all... ofcourse thiS is NOT financial advise you fucking boomer shart! This is my point of view of what I have noted and came across the internet with my smooth brain over the last couple days.

my dear retarded fellow GME autists!! As you for **SURE** already know with your 15.somwhat IQ the literally fucked shorters have no options left... they are soooo fucking fucked in their poopy makers, that they have resorted to and intensifying their controversial dirty tactieks!!

Obligatory rockets for goodluck: **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀**

Their only weapons they are using now is creating Bearish BULLSHIT news and trying to speak thru all their channels (uhem uhem Cramer bitch is fake news).... Some even trying to make you believe that they are our friends and on our side (god fucking dammit i hate that sleezy fucker Cramer) or Bullish (spreadig disguised bearish news as they think we wont see)

THEY ARE SPREADING FUD to stop the momentum and the FOMO that has been build on friday. They may and try and flood the market, but we buy all the dips like its chocolate sunday and we smooth brains actually forgot its winter behind the wall!!

DONT forget that diamond hands 💎🖐 probably get 72 virgins in heaven which you can share with your wifes boyfriend... I have Islamic roots so I actually am officially allowed to promis you this.

Don't fucking settle for 65$... I know I wont.... don't fucking be a retard and sell at 420.69... howeever you are a less degenerate retard if you sell at 694.20.

REMEMBER GUYS... THE fucking **BASE** VALUE **BEGINS** at 800$ and can go up to 2400 (see link 1 for big brain explanation) . So even if there is a dip on the way to the moon and your lambo's dont be a retard and sell... EVEN if the squeeze doesnt squoze (which is inevitable in my opinion) and everything is fucked just have patiénce until our lord and savior RC turn this Blockbuster into the goddamn E-commerce with a value of 50 billion dollar so you can sell at an organic price of 800. In mY OPINION THERE IS NO FUCKING LOSS into jumping into this fucking space-ship.

THIS IS not fucking done!! THIS IS HISTORY IN THE MAKING!!! FUCKING LIVE THIS MOMENT VIVIDLY AND ENJOY!! YOU AND I ARE MAKING HISTORY!! YOU WILL BE PLAYED IN A HOLLYWOOD MOVIE BY NONE OTHER THAN MICHAEL CERA AND OR GUZMAN ( I will be played by DiCaprio of course). WE ARE 2.1 MILLION strong and CANT SLEEP THRU THIS FOMO! THE SHORTERS HAVE NOTHING ON US!! YOU WILL NOT MAKE THEIR WEAPONS EFFECTIVE AGAINST US.

Please help a sister with the following:
‘Limit price’ - this is the option coming up, what does it mean and what do I put in there?
‘Expiry’ - day only, good till cancelled, select date? What do I choose?

Also when do you suggest I buy today? 
Do I just follow thereafter and ‘sell’ when the value goes up (hopefully).

Last friday we experience halts on GME trading purely because of a halt/stop of trading that was triggered by what is called a LULD ([click here to read all about LULD](https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/content/MarketRegulation/LULD_FAQ.pdf)). 

LULD is basically an automatic mechanism which halts trading of a stock if it goes up by 10% in 5 minutes.... GME was soaring and flying to the moon so 10% is nothing but a bitch so it triggered a LULD.... a lot of paper handed bitches paniced and sold to shorters which killed the upward momentum. It is almost certain this will happen again the following days (We are flying duh!!)...

The shorts have not been squozen yet. Today looks like it was another gamma squeeze since calls topped out at 115 dollars and that's where it took off, then reverted. 

That means the thesis is intact. The squeeze is yet to come. Look, everyone's life is different, if you *need* some of the profit, no judgement. Just keep an eye on the prize, shall we?

“You should check open short positions. If the open interest is high you can bet the stock will drop significantly.”

When I asked for clarification on some of the terminology, he followed with: 

“Open interest is how many and how much $ are held in shorting contracts. If there is high open interest, that means many people are currently shorting the stock. Many times in a short squeeze, these positions have to be covered when the stock goes up, but almost immediately new short positions are initiated. Putting incredible heavy downward pressure on a stock. So a rally can be very short lived. This is heavy action, no place for the little guys like you and me!”

“You should check open short positions. If the open interest is high you can bet the stock will drop significantly.”

When I asked for clarification on some of the terminology, he followed with: 

“Open interest is how many and how much $ are held in shorting contracts. If there is high open interest, that means many people are currently shorting the stock. Many times in a short squeeze, these positions have to be covered when the stock goes up, but almost immediately new short positions are initiated. Putting incredible heavy downward pressure on a stock. So a rally can be very short lived. This is heavy action, no place for the little guys like you and me!”

Citadel LLC and Point72        Asset Management are investing $2.75 billion into        hedge fund Melvin Capital Management, which has been hard hit        by a series of short bets to start the year.     

The influx of cash is expected to help stabilize Melvin, which in 2021        has lost 30% through Friday, said people familiar with the firm. Melvin        started the year with $12.5 billion and had been one of        the best performing hedge funds on Wall Street in        recent years. The losses stem from Melvin's array of short bets against        companies and have stunned clients and other traders. Among other short        positions, Melvin bet against the surging stock of videogame retailer        GameStop Corp.     

Citadel and its partners are investing $2 billion        and Point72, which already had more than $1 billion        invested in Melvin as of 2019, $750 million. The        investments are in Melvin's fund and include non-controlling revenue        shares in the firm. Melvin founder Gabe Plotkin was a        top portfolio manager at Point72's predecessor firm, SAC Capital        Management, before he left to start Melvin.     

It couldn't be determined how much of a revenue share Citadel        and Point72 would get.     

Melvin had been down about 15% for the year through late last week --        but heavily shorted stocks soared Friday. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s        basket of the 50 stocks with the highest short interest as a share of        market capitalization soared Friday, bringing its gains for the year to        25%. In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 had gained 2.4% for the period. Unlike        many other hedge funds, Melvin has an expansive and aggressive short        book.     

T**he deal came together rapidly. Mr. Plotkin said in a        statement Monday, ""I am incredibly proud to partner with Ken        Griffin and Steve Cohen. The team at Melvin is        eager to get to work and reward the confidence of these two great        investment icons.""**     

Point72 founder Mr. Cohen in a statement called his        former employee ""an exceptional investor and leader. We are pleased to        have the opportunity to invest additional capital."" Citadel        founder Ken Griffin applauded Melvin's results over the        history of the firm and said, ""We have great confidence in Gabe and his        team.""     

Melvin since its 2014 founding has returned an average of 30% a year.

But that doesn't mean big money has to sell, right, if they add money? So within this week I assume some big business dudes will zoom together, and I assume most of them are not happy about what's happening with GME, because let's be honest, even for GME management this is kinda ducked up... managers want control and this is way beyond their comfort zone for sure. So back to Friday: What if some rich dudes, who all studied together and support each other, team up like we do, and bail out the shorts? who gets that bailout money? The banks? Well, wouldn't that be a nice conspiracy? This time corps help the banks, next time the banks help the corps.

The stock market is basically voodoo hocus pocus and not for plebs like me, so I've never invested. While researching all the shenanigans going on right now, I read interviews with the hedge fund managers. One said that this was a bad play and that the market should have some semblance to reality. Really bitch? Is that what your people said when everyone's 401Ks were pissed away in 2008? How can you justify that statement when the stock market is at an all time high while tens of millions of people are on unemployment? The market doesn't resemble reality and you're a fucking leech. Right then I downloaded Robinhood and put in a big amount (for me) into GME. Honestly, if I lose it all but know that the hedge fund dickheads lost even more I'll feel that I put my money to good use.

Victory is near because they lost $4 BILLION trying to scare diamond hands which ultimately backfired and just made shares more expensive causing us to reach new all time highs. Soon they will just cut their losses and take a loan to overpay for our shares.

Now do you get why its called Diamond hands? Because you know what you have. Don't panic you will soon be over compensated if you are patient. Thats why DeepFuckingValue doesn't sell because he knows exactly what his shares are worth.

l594lp,Chaoticgoodmanson,2021-01-26 07:43:06,GME,"\[OBLIGATORY DO YOUR OWN DUE DILIGENCE AND TYPICAL NON-ADVISORY CAVEATS.\]

Yesterday morning, January 25, 2021, GME opened up on the NYSE at $96 from a $65 close last Friday, January 22. From NYSE open at 9:00 AM ET to 10:45 AM ET, GME absolutely rocketed, hitting $159 intra-day before being halted limit up. But we all know what happened next...

At exactly 10:46 AM ET, as many of you other GME holders will reluctantly recall, GME started to precipitously tank down to nearly $88 at exactly 11:11 AM ET, and suffered additional drops down to as low as almost $61 at 12:24 PM ET, due in part to panic selling, with multiple limit down halts along the way (note: searches for how to buy GameStop's stock surged in popularity on Google through the weekend and may have led to paper-handed FOMOrs buying on the way up and running for the hills on the way down). What happened behind the scenes that could have caused such a promising squeeze to fizzle out so drastically right after the limit up halt ended?

ONE THEORY \[AGAIN, DUE YOUR OWN DUE DILIGENCE\]:

First, we need to consider the timing. At EXACTLY 10:46 AM ET (timing sound familiar?), the humongous SPY ETF also started on a relatively huge tank from $384 (exactly where it opened up at and held for the first 75 minutes of trading) down to $378 (an over 1% plunge on what had been a calm day, and the lowest marks of the day) until EXACTLY 11:11 AM ET (timing sound familiar?).

Maybe this was just a coincidence, or, just maybe, shorts were being so absolutely squeezed (see more in the paragraph below) that they had to start fire selling their SPY just so they could double-down (or, possibly even more nefariously, sell ladder down, i.e. shorts manipulatively selling back and forth to each other at lower and lower prices to to give the illusion of greater sell volume at lower and lower prices to make all the long buyers run for the hills so the shorts can close out without bankrupting themselves).

We also saw today that Melvin Capital, (CEO: Gabe Plotkin), one of the most well-known short sellers of GameStop, got a $2.75 BILLION “investment” (**cough cough, liquidity crunch**) from Citadel ($2B; CEO: Ken Griffen) and Point 72 ($750mm; CEO: Steve Cohen). [https://www.google.com/amp/s/finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/melvin-announces-2-75-billion-221700897.html](https://www.google.com/amp/s/finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/melvin-announces-2-75-billion-221700897.html).

Something very shady could be going on behind the scenes. If there really was a liquidity crunch from the shorts and behind-the-scenes short manipulation (and it was not all just some grand coincidence), several big, possibly bad-actor shorts may have systematically defrauded millions of investors out of billions of dollars of gains to save themselves from fund-ending losses. The shorts may not be able to hold back the flood gates much longer if buying pressure increases throughout the day tomorrow and this week.

LET ME BE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR: I do not advocate for anyone to break the law in any way, shape or form. For further clarification, this is all a working hypothesis, but the timing coincidences were too eery not to share.

l5ez14,WalrusFTW,2021-01-26 14:23:26,GME,Remember Longs. To tie up all available shares. What needs to be done is we need active orders on all owned shares. So set a sell limit order of say 1000 a share. And set the good till date good till cancel. Basically the same system we are fighting allows shorts to borrow our shares to use against up. This is in the fine print when you sign up with your broker. How do you beat them. Put an active order on the share. As long as there is an active order on your shares then the banks cannot lend the shorts your shares to bet against you. Which in return will create a higher share price for us all. Some brokers have auto lend option they can check off but some do not. Just to be sure put an active order on the shares. This will raise the price significantly. In return will scare the crap out of the short poaition forcing them to cover. And bam we win . End of story. Thanks me later.,PUT ACTIVE ORDERS ON YOUR SHARES!!!

While it is recently small investors fighting with institutions, they can use of market fluctuation. Many portfolio would rebalance their position automatically when SPX drops too fast.

&amp;#x200B;

So, do NOT set cut loss limited sell; alternatively, with a non-margin basis, allocate a convenient portion of your cash to set a limited low price buy to build a buying wall. It can build foundation to defend position against short power which it will not necessary to be triggered but short sellers will not have advantageous position to naked short in a huge volume.  


For example, if you holds 1 shares at 100, today's Low is 85. Once there are significant numbers of limited buy at certain level below 85, let's say 80, you can reduce your holding cost whilst everyone are protecting one others from panic sell.  


It is not always attack during a war while defence is equally important. I think it won't have over 130 until Thursday. You may not buy, but do NOT panic sell.",make use of every dip

What can you do to stop it?

EASY  PUT IN A HIGH LIMIT ORDER against your shares.  SOME FIRMS only allow LIMIT ORDERS within 50% of current price.  SET THE HIGHEST LIMIT YOU CAN.. and WALK THE LIMIT UP AS WE GO TO THE MOON!

Obligatory 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀. College student, definitely not financial advice. I was a non-believer, but God works in mysterious ways. I count my blessing to have made the final boarding call on the GME train.

I got into 30.64 shares of GME this morning @ 292. [Proof](https://imgur.com/a/Xuqxsv3)

Like you, I am holding to the 🌚. And like you, I know the short squeeze mechanics is correct, and THEY will have to cover their short positions very VERY soon. As such, WE **set the price**. Not figuratively. **WE LITERALLY SET THE PRICE.** How, you ask? By putting in limit orders.

[Scroll down a bit and you'll see](https://imgur.com/a/Xuqxsv3) I have put my limit order to be $3,000, and you should do the same. **Whatever price you put is the price the HFs will have to buy them back for, or higher, could be this very Friday.** Obviously I could cancel it but I'm no 📄hands bitch. Not even gonna consider selling until at least $3,000.

Happy harvesting fellow autists. Fuck Shittron, and put in your limit orders asap. **IT'S THE ULTIMATUM TO WALL STREET.**","GME Endgame: WE SET THE PRICE! Put in limit orders of at least $3,000+"

I looks green and pretty.  They need your shares and it will cost them everything since they decided to double down.  The float was 138.4% short and now it's 292.53% short.  

They need your shares and if you don't give it to them.....they are paying each day to hold their position.  They will be backing up truck loads to get your shares for 2k, 4k.  They have to buy back.  Get every share you can and hold it.  

This is life changing money for a lot of us.  These guys took all that liquidity money from the fed to cause this.  They didn't settle their positions on their shorts and take profits.  They doubled down multiple times.  There are shady things at play.  Being locked out of Robinhood of all days knowing that was the target of so much GME buying.

Ocwen Financial Inc. OCN serves all $3B of Novation Companies Inc. OTC NOVC RMBS, NQM mortgage loans. NOVC via 100% owned ex MREIT Novastar Financial Inc. NFI (produced $40B NQM loans, paid out 100% x TI as policy) hold Cleanup Call Rights per Service Rights Transfer Agreement Sec 5.04 filed at back of NOVC Q3 2007 on most of $3B PORTFOLIO OF RBMS, NQM MORTGAGE LOANS.

Could Fortress like to absorb $728M NOLs at NOVC by doing a SPAC and adding OCN to NOVC. NOVC also owns [H](http://www.healthcare-staffing.com/)ealthcare Staffing, Inc. which per 201910K (certified by Boulay Group MN TOP 100 Ranked CPA firm) did $62M grew 16% yr over yr all tax free. Could Fortress want to copy their reorganization of Newcastle Inv Grp x NCT aka Drive Shack DS (NRZ, SNR, NEWM) at NOVC by spinning NFI off as MREIT like NRZ and deploy cleanup call rights on most $3B portfolio leveraging and resecuritizing NFI aka NOVC CCR at NIMs of 555 Bpts producing annual dividend of 1.5 to 4.12 depending on the leverage, NIMs and actual buy back of bonds in the portfolio at discount. Fortress loves this maneuver. NOVC collateral assets per Bond Remittance reports and press release Mid 2018 show WAC of 600 Bpts.

Fortress owns 25% 31.3M shares of NOVC with other MREIT, MBS, CCR, MSR experts Manny Friedman, Neal Wilson co CEOs of EJF Capital also Founders of FBR. EJF and Fortress control all NOVC Sr Debt which they paid little to nothing via CDO Service Rights. Fortress past co investors from DX (Wesley Edens was COB of CMO which owned DX, Edens COB of Fortress and Edens was COB of Newcastle Inv Group also known as Drive Shack DS, which Fortress reorganized into 3 MREIT NRZ, SNR, NEWM aka GCI before changing the name from NCT to DS (per 10K Fortress owns at least 10M NRZ shares probably more if you include warrants and is paid 1.5% x gross equity by NRZ shareholders). Does Fortress desire the same win at NOVC.

Fortress is OCN Fortress is or was NCT changed name to Drive Shack DS (after spinning off 3 MREIT NRZ), Fortress is NOVC which hides their and Sr Debt Partners ID behind CDOs that control all NOVC Sr Debt, courtesy of past Co Investor DX investors Barry Igdaloff and Howard Amster (BI and HA NOVC Board members, Igdaloff still Board of DX) who along with friends &amp; ex DX investors own at least 36M or 32% of NOVC shares including ex COB and CEO of DX Thomas Akin/his HF Talkot Capital. Mass Mutual and sub Barings own 19.3M and appear to be in sync with Igdaloff and friends. To be sure as NOVC controlling shareholders Fortress, Wesley Edens, Peter Briger, Michael Huang, Portfolio Manager at NRZ and EMPLOYEE OF FORTRESS AND their pals from Dynex Capital NYSE DX sitting on NOVC Board. Google Fortress 2010 purchase of all CDO Service Rights on Taberna CDOs. Fortress paid $15.9M to control $6B AUM. NOVC Sr Debt is 2.3rd held by Fortress via Taberna I and II see Dan Bass, CFO of Fortress executed 1st amendment to NOVC Sr Debt. NOVC Sr Debt is paltry % of 6B AUM.

Fortress makes billions on their NOVC equity vs their FMV of Sr Debt, Boulay Group CPA firm for NOVC 2019 10K certified FMV of NOVC Sr Debt at $21m, Fortress position via CDOs Taberna I and II in NOVC Sr Debt is ONLY $14M vs Billions they could make if they copy their reorganization plan from NCT aka DS see slide 4 of presentation Wesley Edens made to NCT aka Drive Shack DS shareholders

What you are all doing is SO inspiring, and I felt obligated to join in 😁 I've bought into GME and will be holding strong to &gt;1000. WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER! Let's disrupt the market and squeeze some shorts!

If we can force short sellers to buy in, we will redistribute potentially hundreds of millions of dollars. This squeeze is huge, but imagine the power we will have in the market with 10x-100x the capital we are each wielding.

For far too long, hedge funds and large investors have forced companies into bankruptcy and stolen money from the general public (individuals like you with families, just trying to survive). This is our opportunity to begin an even greater revolution, taking that money back and reinvesting it into a better world.

Nobody should have to struggle to survive. Hundreds of billions of dollars are tied up in short positions in countless companies, held by people who have more money than they will ever need. This money can be used to uplift humanity, empower sustainable and progressive companies, revert the climate crisis and regenerate the planet's ecology. This is our time to begin fueling this transition.

It starts with GME, but it could end with all of us having the resources we need to redesign the foundations of human civilization.

What all of these have in common is either a too low target for exit on Gamestop, or are diverting the money around to other tickers to cause a flow out of it. 

These are definitely short sock puppet accounts, they are running SCARED. The squeeze has not squoze, we're still on.

But here's some honesty to remedy the stress. You are not Professor X. Staring at the screen, panicking when the share price drops by 10% won't do anything.

Instead of wasting time burning your retinas and driving up your adrenaline, take a moment to realize that this kind of squeeze has never happened before in history. Hundreds of thousands of retail traders like yourself have decided to come together and contribute what they can, and they are dedicated to seeing this stock rise exponentially. We are here to squeeze short-shorts and disrupt the economy. Trust us.

Trust in the power of unity. Trust in the power of teamwork and collaboration. This stock will rise higher. But you have to be patient, and spending all of your time staring at the screen won't make time move faster. It will just stress your nervous system and exhaust you.

Instead of watching the market fluctuate, close your trading platform, shut down your device and focus on something else. Share a meal with someone you love, take your dog for a walk or get some fresh air, talk to a friend or write a letter. Read or listen to a book that you love, watch a movie or show that you enjoy. Cook some delicious food, listen to music and dance. Do something that uplifts your spirit and demands all of your attention and focus. Get into your body and out of your head, and check in on your portfolio later.

The world needs you to express yourself and love life. In the meantime, your money will work for you.

l6ed29,sophisticatedaddy,2021-01-27 21:04:16,GME,"I Present To You: The GME Gamma Short Feedback Squeeze

Unfortunately WSB mods already took this down twice, so here I am.

What an exciting time to be alive! We're gonna bust an institutional short hedge fund Robinhood-style in the middle of a global pandemic and trigger a great redistribution of wealth.

TLDR: Short squeeze trigger might've changed from waiting for GME/RC news about positive GME growth &amp; direction to the gamma squeeze triggering intolerably high prices for shorts and/or margin calling. Short squeeze timeline might've just been moved closer by months. 💎👐 and buy 💰💰 (shares or calls).

🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀

So by now you've probably heard that the price hikes on the past two Fridays were due to gamma squeezes. When calls are purchased, Market Makers buy some shares just in case they have to pay out or provide shares when the contract is settled. This lowers their risk, and they are generally good at not losing money.

So what happened Friday? Literally every open call that was sold at any time hit their strike price became ITM, because the highest strike available was $60 and the stock closed at \~$65. Even if the call didn't expire until 2023, their risk management policies dictate that they must purchase shares to cover their potential downside.

What drives stock prices? Supply and demand. Supply was already low on Friday, and MMs started hedging their positions gobbling up shares left/right/center at whatever price they could get, driving up demand. The stock price surged (praise be) and we collectively did our little happy dances.

Now apparently, these \~10-15M shares should be cleared by around Tuesday and in the hands of anybody deciding to exercise their call options. If those investors 💎👐 and don't sell those shares, it decreases liquidity and increases the ceiling of the gamma short feedback squeeze.

So the gamma squeeze went like this. People bought calls at any price, for any date, and on Friday they had all finished ITM, profitable for those who hold the calls but painful for MMs and the people who sold the calls who now need to find millions of shares to buy. New calls at higher strikes (\~$115) will be available next week, and the same thing can potentially happen again, especially if there's a good chunk of those outstanding 15M shares that still need to be purchased. What'll happen when people buy calls again on Monday but MMs still need to buy millions of shares by Tuesday? Supply and demand, the price will soar again. What happens when the price approaches ITM territory for new outstanding calls? MMs need to hedge by buying shares. What happens when MMs need to buy more shares from a smaller pool of available shares? Supply and demand.

We've achieved the gamma feedback loop.

🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀

Buying ITM or near OTM calls will force MMs to hedge by buying more shares which will raise the stock price and bring higher-strike calls closer to ATM/ITM which forces them to buy more shares, all in a vicious loop.

DO, NOT, SELL, YOUR, SHARES.

Now, onto the short squeeze.

There are still 102.3% shares shorted. Literally more shares have been shorted than Gamestop has issued. As of Friday after market close, the short squeeze has not yet squoze.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2xc4o/gme\_moass\_update\_ortex\_data\_12221](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2xc4o/gme_moass_update_ortex_data_12221/)

🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀

So what is the short squeeze?

A quick background because some are new to this, but since it's been explained in plenty of other DDs for months now here's the short version (haha).

Certain huge hedge funds thought GME would pull a Blockbuster and implode down to $0. They completely ignore the fact that the ex-CEO of Nintendo Americas is now on the Board of Directors, along with Ryan Cohen and the two people that helped him build Chewy from nothing to a $3.5B pet-lovers powerhouse that beat Amazon at online retail in the. The legend outcompeted Jeff fucking Bezos after getting denied funding by \~100 VCs, and he only sold Chewy cause his beloved mentor/father suddenly died while he was getting ready to take Chewy public.

PetSmart bought Chewy for $3.5B and promptly IPOd it to $10B.

After the last earnings report he threatened the GME BOD to stop dropping the ball, OR ELSE. So he put his money where his mouth is and bought 13% of GME. They listened, struck a deal with him and are getting ready to pivot GME (just like $BB). GME will do two main things:

1. Transform their online presence to make it the Amazon of gaming
2. Update their retail locations to enter into the PC gaming market

All of this was discovered thanks to many hard-working autists who put together fantastic DDs which are now making us bank. We salute you, and personally, thank you very much because this will measurably change my life (which is why I'm writing this).

Previous to the two GME gamma squeezes, we were essentially waiting for GME to announce what our hard-working autists have been telling us ever since RC released his warning letter to the GME BOD. Why is this important?

Because the bears still believe in their bear thesis.

The bears still think GME will Blockbuster and they believe the bump in stock price is the equivalent of a ""dip"" for them, so they doubled-down on their short position.

Until their thesis is proven wrong/outdated via news from either GME or RC outlining GME's new growth plans, shorts will cling to their bear thesis and think we are delusional retards. Truth is, we just figured out GME's plan before the shorts did, and we're clinging to the unofficial news because it simply, makes, sense.

SOOO, once the news breaks that GameStop actually has a really good growth plan, bears will say ""awe fuck"" and start buying shares to close out their short position. Except wait, supply and demand again. There are so few shares now that they would have to buy our shares, sell them back, buy them again at a higher price, sell them back, buy them again at a higher price, sell them again, and on and on again to the moon, about 13x. That will be the true squeeze we have all been waiting for.

What we didn't realize is that

1. The catalyst to trigger the short squeeze has potentially changed, and
2. The timeline might've just moved a lot closer to the present day

🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀

I Present To You: The Gamma Short Feedback Squeeze

The gamma squeeze causes MMs to buy shares, driving price up. Shares are purchased, fewer shares are available to be purchased, price goes up. This increases the loss floor of the shorted shares for short sellers and increases the interest paid to continue shorting them. Remember, shorting a stock caries unlimited risk because a share price can climb to an unlimited height. As the risk increases, the shorts get scared. If they are forced to cover, their losses will be proportional to the increase of the stock price. Higher price = higher losses for them. They can keep paying interest, but at some point the risk becomes too great and they throw in the towel. Now that GME has hit mainstream media, everybody and their grandmother has heard in the news that GME squeeze is incoming and is getting in on the game. Supply and demand, supply goes down, price goes up, gamma squeeze forces MMs to buy more to hedge, supply goes down, price goes up.

Price keeps going up, shorts get mighty nervous. They might decide to ride it out for a few years and eatthe interest payments, EXCEPT......

When there are no more shares available to trade, margin calls will begin. Shares that were purchased with borrowed funds will be forcibly liquidated, and you can bet that at some point Melvin's shorts will be forcibly margin called.

🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀

Boom, short squeeze triggered by the gamma squeeze: The Gamma Short Feedback Squeeze

🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀

The gamma squeeze will firstly drive the price a lot higher BEFORE the main short squeeze. It will also feedback into the short squeeze which increases with probability every time more shares are taken off the board and every time the stock price increases.

All you have to do, is💎👐, and if you can, buy 💰💰 (shares or calls).

This is history in the making, an unprecedented event. Not only is the ratio of shares shorted to shares realistically available to sell higher than the 2008 VW short squeeze, but it's getting turbocharged by a gamma squeeze too. We are double-dipping this bitch!! This went from a once-in-a-decade opportunity to a once-in-a-century play, and we get to take from shitty companies counting on others to fail and redistribute their wealth to the average retard.

If you benefit from this play, please remember to set aside funds for taxes (bless you tax-free TFSA) and for charity.

&amp;#x200B;

Position: 455 shares @ various price points. Legal disclaimer; I'm a retard and not giving you financial advice, just what I think might happen.

Also, I listed my 7-series for sale and will buy a $3k shitbox to drive until the squeeze has squoze, sinking the sale proceeds directly into $GME. When this happens I'll be able to upgrade to a lambo instead.","Found this online, it’s amazing! GME 🚀 HOLD HOOOOOLD"

Ok, let’s play a game. All two million of us.
The goal of the game is to guess the “right” number (between 0 and 100). The right number is 2/3 of the average of all of our guesses. This is what happens:
1. Well 2/3 of 50 is 33, so 33 would be the best guess. Right? Wrong! This is a game with other (semi)intelligent players. The distribution is not random, it influenced by other players  strategy. 
2. Ok so then I will pick 2/3 of 33 because everyone is going to pick 33. Right? Maybe... It depends on how well the group understands the game.  Do you see where this is going? 
3. 2/3 of 50 is 33.3.meaning the strategic players will guess 33.3 bringing the Winning number down to 22.2. Then the strategic players^2 will guess 14.8. So if everyone figures out the game, the best guess would be... Zero. 

Now you understand infinite regress. Apply this, in the inverse, to GME. Let’s say you want to sell at 2/3 of peak value, somewhere between 0 and ♾. This could perpetuate upward indefinitely. The key is that the more intelligent players in this game (💎🖐🏼)the higher that number goes. Just as in the first example 100% perfect understanding of the game’s mechanics led to 0 being the right pick, if everyone sees where this game leads, GME is worth infinity. Of course bankrupting the shorts would be a hypothetical upper limit. But essentialy this is a glitch in the matrix.🕳🐇

Please leave ideas in comments and I will take the ones upvoted the most and attach them to the post. 

My goal is to help Ryan Cohen in brainstorm. We got him this far we can get him to tendietown. 

1. My Idea:  Create a GameStop platform where people can compete against each other for real money on video games. Additionally, create a GameStop cryptocurrency and use that for all wagers and exchanges. Some live locations can even have competitions between people. Win GameToken? 

The point is this capitalizes on the cryptocurrency trend as well as the sports betting trend while staying in line with the video games motif of the company. If the cryptocurrency itself takes off and is exchanged for real dollars similar to bitcoin or ethereum then GameStop would essentially have its own cryptocurrency that we can further buy into?

Narrative so far

1/11-1/15 - GME was a minor footnote of unusual volume attributed to RC and pals joining the board.

1/19-1/20 - Sideshow of ""robinhood traders"" or ""merry men"" that was about to implode.

1/21-1/22 - These people have a mean streak to them, they are targeting the bears and being mean to Citron.

1/23-1/25 - 🌈🐻 Hedge Fund Payola hit job - This is some kind of pump and dump, illegal coordination, SEC needs to act to save the patriots at melvin capital. 

Yesterday (1/26) - This is a train wreck that we can't look away from mixed with the 🌈🐻 payola narrative

Today - there is a little glimmer of positivity towards us 

* There is no more denial that we caught the 🌈🐻's with their dicks in the cookie jar.
* There is some pushback to the payola that we are somehow doing something unfair in kicking the bears' asses and not capitulating
* I think some of the evidence in what I am hearing and reading that a few of these journalists and talking heads have actually read a non-meme post and maybe started to cross reference the GME DD with reality and seeing that it checks out.

&amp;#x200B;

Hopeful narrative for next week or two

* If you are still a 🌈🐻, seek the advice of a bankruptcy attorney
* The short squeeze rally may be never-ending unless there is some kind of settlement that involves Gamestop Corp and overwhelmingly favors GME shareholders and ensures there are no retail bag holders
   * I proposed something here last week, but I think the target settlement number should probably be changed to 694.20/share or 1420.69/share this week.
   * [https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/l2uasj/alternate\_ending\_for\_gme/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/l2uasj/alternate_ending_for_gme/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)
* SEC should be more concerned about the market manipulation that was done by the hedge funds
   * 2019-2020 against old GME shareholders
   * Coordination between Melvin/Citadel/Point72 re: bailout
   * Payola hitjob that started late last week
   * Anti-retail moves by brokers and MM
   * Bot attacks on Reddit
   * Pump and dump targeted at retail and specifically GME shareholders on other shiny objects by those bots.",Media coverage shift in our favor

l6ibc3,Theohunt,2021-01-28 00:00:13,GME,"1.  EDIT ITS BACK AND I TOLD YOU


The WSB subreddit isn’t taken down, it’s set to private. Too many bots, shills (NOK etc) were overwhelming the bots and Reddit’s server load. They’ve taken it down before to clean it up, implement new rules and structure. This is not an issue

2. There is a dramatic after hours drop right now. This is alright and due to paperhands who FOMOd, SEC fearmongering (of which they’ll do little), and other factors. AH volume is not even 10% of what it was yesterday.

3. European and Asian markets are not in play yet which typically provide a boost and will capitalize on this dip.

4. If you’re new, hold. If you’re like me and saw your 1/15 $30 calls drop to $40 before going to $5,600 the next day - you know to hold. The short squeeze has not been unwound, the gamma squeeze is still potentially happening. My theory is that they’re capitalizing on the FUD surrounding the WSB cleaning. Stay tuned here for updates.

5. I’ve been in for a long time, and watching the ticker and doing DD daily. I’ll try to answer questions - basic ones like “how do I buy” I’ll leave to Google. 


PS - I’m not a mod so help me out, any non GME ticker can fuck off to a different Reddit - DOWNVOTE. Any person urging you to sell - DOWNVOTE. Trash is spilling over into this thread.",STATUS OF $GME

This situation made history and I’m grateful to WSB for teaching me so much over the years. I probably won’t be invited to the private sub because I was never a big swinger in the sub and I never really networked with people from there which I sad because I don’t think I’m the only one getting left out in the cold with the 3.4 million people who joined since March.

He posted this on ruqqus


Things are tough right now. The platforms that support us are not making life easy on us.

Discord banned our server ""for hatespeech"", which is crap. We used bots to block out naughty words and stuff.

What they're really saying is that if you get too big you will be deleted at their discretion because there will always be some activity you cannot keep an eye on that can be used to paint you as a bad group.

What we're scared about is that the same kind of thing will happen on Reddit. I've been making a scene with the admins because our Reddit bots can't even see posts and reply to them fast enough to do anything.

How can we risk being responsible for messages we can't even moderate? Hence, we're private right now. Not deleted.




You can check yourself if you don’t believe me. I don’t want to leave a link in case it crashes the site due to them not having the capability for that amount of traffic.

l6j0o9,enlightened_autist,2021-01-28 00:31:28,GME,"TLDR: 💎🖐💎🖐💎🖐🚀🚀🚀🌑

Listen up degens, it's literally impossible for GME to can't go tits up. GME currently has 65.2 million shares outstanding, and 485.5 million of total debt. Using a share price of 250/share, they can issue more stock to raise $ 815 million in capital with only a 5% share dilution (3.26 million 65.2 million).

At this point they have no debt and approx $330 million left in cash. They look at selling some of their assets as well to raise more capital in order to re-structure. Now the previous narrative of a dieing retailer is no longer relavant. Easily 150+ in fundamental value and 4200.69 in actual value.

Look at fucking TSLA, if you only look at it as a car company, probs only worth 300/share but its actually a distributed energy and transportation software company that happens to sell cars. With that factored in its probs worth 6969.42.

NEVER SELL.

l6jgni,upotheke,2021-01-28 00:48:56,GME,"I don't own GME despite being a previous store manager. I do understand the situation. With a Master's degree in Communication, namely cultural discourse, I'm fascinated at how this story is being told, here and otherwise.

Bias alert, I'm generally in agreement with what I've seen from DFV.

That being said, here's a recent popular media story about this - [https://www.huffpost.com/entry/redditors-myth-stock-market\_n\_6011bd16c5b61cb9535099d6](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/redditors-myth-stock-market_n_6011bd16c5b61cb9535099d6)

""The hedge funds are furious..."", ""calling for a crackdown on the Reddit kids..."" ""Redditors have reveled in the absurdity by being absurd."" I find it fascinating that the initial crux of what is declared as ""value discovery"" is completely lost here. More importantly, I don't feel it is lost unintentionally.

As I understand it, DFV knew GME was shorted beyond 100% stock capacity, a naked short as it were. Regardless of GME's earnings, this is an important point for two reasons. 1) Value is whatever someone is willing to pay, leveraging over 100% stock obviously puts a fulcrum on the leveraged and perceived value. 2) Discursively shifting the value hype from an over-shorted stock to ""absurd Redditors"" masks the foundational flaws that make the naked short stock positions *illegal*. Multiple mass-media coverages of this story make the same two discursive moves. 1) Confuse the origin of value, and 2) Shift the active cause from illegal market action to anons on Reddit.

Cultural discourse is a very powerful and substantive thing, hard to change and durable because we all generally agree to these unspoken norms due to years of education and cultural conditioning. The reframing done by many covering the GME story is meaningful, insofar as the activity around this stock has caused both naive and I would argue strategic discursive pushback.

Be aware of it, and don't fall for it.

When ""Redditors"" are the bad guys, rather than the *illegally* over-leveraged positions, the cause of the market failure is discursively shifted. When ""value is arbitrary"" rather than tied to legitimate market mechanisms of a short, the cause of the market failure is discursively shifted. When the cause of the market failure is discursively shifted, the original violators are protected and those who take advantage of it are ""opportunists"" and derided. Derided for ignorance, for being a mob, for not participating in the system designed to benefit hedge funds.

Be aware of it, and don't fall for it.

To get such censure, generally uniformly, by so many institutional media platforms should indicate this GME activity has poked the bear, and the bear must maintain status quo. The status quo of the stock market is a multi-trillion dollar industry. The pushback will be fierce. It will be subtle, and overt, and come from many angles. It is intentional and designed to force conformity.

I have no advice on paper or diamonds, and don't profess it. I only want to highlight the very dramatic and important discursive movements happening on one of the more foundational elements of our economy and society. This is a big deal, so watch as this develops accordingly. It will get more fierce. Reddit will be slammed as ignorant, the mob, pranksters, or worse. Censure and marginalization will only increase until this whole thing plays out. This is a big deal, and I wish you all end up ok. The status quo is watching.",The narrative around this is fascinating

**A SIMPLE FACT THAT SOME PEOPLE DON'T KNOW: after hour trading and pre market trading has very low volume hence has very high fluctuation.** The stock price is determined by supply and demand. If I suddenly sell, say, 10k shares, while there are only 1k people waiting to buy, the price will drop significantly. However, if I want the price to drop the same amount, I'll need to sell 1000k shares, since there are 100 times more people there waiting to buy. **I can use very little amount of shares to ""mark down"" the after hour price.** (Disclaimer: vice versa)

**BUT FOR SOMEONE WITHOUT ANY KNOWLEDGE OF THE MARKET, she/he might feel like ""wtf!!! It's gonna crash??? I need to sell my order as soon as the market reopen tomorrow!!!""** While, if you understand what I just said, you'll find this logic not correct: whether there will be a dip/crash/peak/squeeze/whatever, is determined at the regular hour. This is also why there are some significant movements at the stock opening today and yesterday: those whales, long or short, just don't agree with the price after market/pre market, and they'll establish their price at stock opening.

**Ironically, if lots of (misinformed) people do feel this (logically not correct) way and sell, the price will drop.** Then shorts will be happy. (Disclaimer: I'm not saying hold and diamond hands)

But I am all balls in now, at this exact moment In time, and have made the financial decision myself to buy whatever stock I want, including Game Stop (GME), and anything in the public stock market available to me. 

I can (and will) hold whatever fucking security, real estate, non-real and real property I want - Not because of a mass amount of people are doing the same shit- but because this is my right and in my best interest. I know what I have, and what I hold and where I have placed my hard earned, pencil pushing money. 

Melvin fucking Capital (and their fuck bud Hedgies) are getting their asses pounded, long dick style right now because they, too, have these same rights as me: they can fucking buy, hold or sell whatever security they want at whatever price they choose to (as long as the market allows). 

But these future bag holding bitches used more money to “invest” than I will ever have in my entire life, and likely, the 20 kids I plan on having; They  have so much money available to them that they the have power to drive the market down or up (you don’t have to be Elon Musk to know this, boomers).
But we know that in their case, it’s not necessarily their money or securities. 

Anyway, they made their choice like I made mine. 
They are reasonable and prudent people. As a matter of fact, they are licensed professionals. (Fucking jokers).
They played their odds and I am playing mine. 

With the exception that these pigs are likely in violation of a bunch of rules and laws that I don’t understand because I am an “average, loser Joe” or a “nobody” like my front and side neighbor and that other dude who decided to make this same move I made. 

Now the little media (puppets of the hedgies) are telling me I am the bad guy for buying a stock?

l6jy0l,Devinione,2021-01-28 01:09:08,GME,"Explanation to hopefully stop panic selling:  

Funds can sell of shares at progressively lower lots to “tap” down prices. And GME enthusiasts may be buying them as a conviction play (it may seem like we are helping ourselves buying here, but it plays into the short strategy...buying but as long as we hold it’s only a temporary decrease in SP). 

&amp;#x200B;

Imagine I have 1 million shares and I sell them in lots of 10,000 each lot $10 cheaper than the next. If people buy, I’ve lowered the stock price by $100 effectively. It’s a classic short move.  If you don’t think Melvin and Shitron and the funds that propped them up aren’t calling in favors like this right now you’re living in fantasy land.  

So for a small amount of shares you can take the price of the stock. It’s only going to save shorts though if once the stock is down everyone panics and sells at the new, lower price. If people hold the line, the stock may be down but shorts will have no one to buy shares to cover from, and the shares they used to drop the price will be exhausted. The volume typically tells the tale of a bear raid. There’s no way this is going to work- 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like this plus the shutdown of wallstreetbets is just going to infuriate GME shareholders more to where holding is a moral issue. Shorts are fucked..

l6mhp0,Latter-Caterpillar25,2021-01-28 03:11:20,GME,"***Not investment advice, Theoretical experiment***

First of all, please read patiently. I am not throwing ice to our passions. But objectively analysing the situation.

Due to too many order placements (as they claimed), broker server was down. But as I said, they are settling GME with dirty hands. 
Since the absence of many discipline investors, what last night did, you better take that as no effect to squeeze anything. Any price beyond 200 is a very fragile situation with no foundation of buying pressure support, but only to smoother the scale of gamma squeeze on Friday.

I would see that as a 6 to 4 bad position on us. But it does not mean no more gamma squeeze. As they kept doing what last night did, volatility drives to rocket with simultaneous effects from a series of technology firms Q4. Indices became very sensitive now which is equivalently risky to them (literally more dangerous for them as their portfolio is more diversified).

Ok, standing as one of us. I am still holding 1500 shares which will never sell until Friday night. But to be honest, I hold this position with profit gained by option on Tuesday (Broker app banned my access trade yesterday) so I can lose them thoroughly and still have around 101.4k profit.

Meanwhile, I wish everyone please remember a few rules of thumb. 
1. No margin trade, no stop loss but limited buy at low price. Hold. 
2. No AMC, BB, etc at the same time... 
    We are small investors, if you don’t focus, whatever accomplished will be fucked up.
3. Squeeze is not we buy up the price... it is not necessary to buy buy buy. Just strong hold and buy AT THE DIP. For me, protection on 200 is essential; any recent price above 200 means nothing. Price goes up gradually with foundation is good sign to us; price goes up from 2xx to 400 in ten minutes is bad sign to us.
4. It is a game of patience and strategy. PLEASE RESTORE DISCIPLINE. no cocky trade on high price; no panic sell. 

I am sure I will not able to access either trading platform or here tonight (I am not American). Hope Gods gives wisdom to all of you whom can trade... be humble and low profile.

Last word, what GME happened is impossible to be duplicated on other stocks right now. Never think you will win GME, AMC, BB,.. all at the same time... focus first!",Basic views after last night

Alright, so I think we all get the message by now: 💎👐🏻, WE LIKE THE STOCK and nobody sell until GME hits this magic meme number. We've been repeating this like clockwork for the past few days, and will continue to until these short fucks stop artificially supressing GameStop.

HOWEVER, I KNOW that some of you lurking here or have stumble across this subreddit are scared because you bought near the top and now the stock price has dropped. You're thinking yourself, ""Why!? Why the fuck did I fall for this shit? I'm such a fucking retard.""

Well let me tell you why you're NOT wrong at all: MASSIVE MARKET MANIPULATION.

The short fucks are SCARED of losing their money above everything else. They're more scared of losing their OWN money than they are of throwing the rest of us folks into recessions. And they know we're ANGRY at them - not just for trying to bankrupt GameStop - a company that employs thousands of Americans - but also because they've been LYING AND DEFRAUDING AVERAGE FOLKS FOR DECADES NOW. Remember the 2007-2008 financial crisis? Remember how millions of people lost their homes and how even more people lost their jobs, life savings, retirement funds, and even their livelihoods?

The greedy fucks on Wall St. played a large part in causing that recession - AND THEN THEY GASLIGHTED US BY PLACING THE BLAME SQUARELY ON US FOR TAKING OUT SHITTY LOANS THAT THEY PUSHED.

So how does that tie back to GameStop stock?

It's simple - they're trying to gaslight you with MASSIVE MARKET MANIPULATION in trying to get you to sell at a lost and use YOUR ABSENCE TO HELP THEMSELVES reduce the massive losses their shorts positions are currently facing. The shorts only win if people sell, you see? But if we 💎👐🏻 our shares, they're eventually going to be FORCED by their lenders to buy our shares at SUPERNOVA LEVEL PRICES.

In other words, IF YOU SELL NOW, YOU HELP OUT THE PEOPLE WHO FUCKED YOU AND THE REST OF US COMMON FOLK 13 YEARS AGO. IF YOU HOLD, YOU GET YOUR JUSTICE AND FUCK THEM OVER.

TLDR - selling now means you help out the people who fucked you and your family during the recession. Holding and selling much later will pretty much guarentee you a shitload of tendies and sweet vengeance.",MASSIVE MARKET MANIPULATION

When the shorts get margin called, their prime brokers liquidate their assets, generally without any consideration (in other words, they generally just start selling to cover the shorts and collect what their client, e.g. hedge funds) owe them.  That means when the client holds stocks of companies that are part of SPY, the prime broker sells those assets to close out the short.  So when GME goes higher after shorts double down and the price stays high/goes up, the shorts get margin called and SPY will sell off.  If enough people diamond hand, it’s not that crazy of an idea that we would see a huge selloff in SPY and a huge redistribution of that wealth to the diamond hand longs.

Benefits of setting a limit of $999,999,999,999, and buying up ALL shares (only 3 steps :))

1. The stocks for GME will HARDEN LIKE OUR 💎🖐🏼 and will STOP TRADING DUE TO MAXIMUM CAPACITY WITH NO LIQUIDITY

2. Once that happens, the only option the shorts have is to EXIT THEIR SHORTS BY BUYING AT $999,999,999,999 PER SHARE

3. After the above happens, each and every one of the share we hold will be worth $999,999,999,999

Therefore there is incentive to keep buying now and setting $999,999,999,999 (your cost of $300 per share will look ridiculously CHEAP)

Anyway that leaves a tradeable float at 34 million and you have 71 million shares short. Then you NOW have 2.2 million CALLS all IN THE MONEY. That's 220 million shares so the market makers and others are net short this stock 291 million - 34 million float for a total of 257 million net short. There is NOT enough shares to go around plain and simple. The float is shorted by about 8X and they are completely stuck. They are doing everything to talk this stock down through media, print, TV internet even these boards are full of these paid shills to get you to sell. It's all a scare tactic. They stopped selling the CALLS today because they finally looked at the numbers and had a epiphany of how bad it really is. Ameritrade stopped trading in it. It's a HUGE game of manipulation and you know what I AM NOT SELLING. These funds that wrote the CALLS and shorted the stock are liquidating a lot of other positions to bring this down.

Short sellers seem to have tried every legal and illegal trick in the book to get the stock down. Last ace up their ass' are politics and media to whom they traditionally probably have good ties. It will be easy to discredit reddit by picking some posts that display the community as reckless, homophobic and dangerous. It will be easy to portrait hedge funds as the needed huntsman that purge unprofitable businesses for the greater good of society. Add some potential job-losses of hardworking business MBAs in their companies and it will be the perfect storm for the young government to get wet feet and agree to a trading stop on Friday. 

Let's make ALL voices heard! There are plenty of journalists who know the struggle is real, who write paycheck-to-paycheck. Until TOMORROW positive, personal stories of how the GME gains will benefit the people might help counter bad press. Stop writing about Lambos, instead cover how the gains help to pay of student loans, secure small and medium businesses without having to rely on government bailouts, and help to secure jobs throughout the world. 

If this makes sense to you, leave the screen, for a walk around the block, and write a polite and positive letters to your local government representatives about the worries of market manipulation and the opportunities for the little people to settle their debts.

Ok so i joined the WSB 2 discord that was posted in r/GME. My name on discord is mail i dont know if they deleted my messages. I joined and there was a profile created recently (if you click on a discord profile picture and try to message them and it is a new account it will say ""Im new to discord say hey"". In their general i get into this weirdly heated debate with a virgin named ""tootenfug"" where he tries to tell me to buy DOGE, which, whatever, but whenever I try to tell people to buy and hold GME he gets pissed and tells me that ""by discouraging people from buying DOGE i am stopping wealth from happening"" or some shit.

I say ""well with heavily shorted stonks, the wealth that will enter our accounts will be more from people and hedges that short the stonk, as opposed to how with crypto, there will always be the investors who are left to hold the bag"". He kept getting really angry with me and calling me a shit ass. I know I am a  shit ass but that doesnt apply here because I am literally right. Shorts need to cover so the value of the share increases causing the stonk to increase in price (ive read so much DD i have it down). 

I continue to ask ""if you are right why are you getting so angry"". The argument continues for a bit until one of the users (I dont remember your name but if i see it I will know who @ 'ed me and asked   
""what do you think about AMC?"". In the middle of my reply, saying how I think AMC has a solid path out of bankruptcy and back into very profitable buisiness after this capital boost from meemers, they ban me. I dont know who, but why would they ban you for saying you were all in on GME? That doesnt make sense unless they had alternative motives. Im writing this post for that investor. Whoever you are, if you are reading this, do not sell GME, they are lying to you, AMC is a good pick if you get in at the right time, buy hold GME and buy more if you can before friday. At the time the discord had 30 members, the group chat was called the ""trading floor"", many of their members were new to discord. I called tootenfug out of that many times, asked if he had read any DD, nothing. Fucking nothing. Just anger whenever I would challenge him about DOGE coin. I asked, ""if it will make us all millionares and non of us will become bagholders, why are you getting so mad by me saying this? Im just one person?"" Beware of this discord. 

He even said ""the hedgefunds are not the priortiy, making money is priority"". I explained that my family had been really hurt by the 2008 crash and if he understood they rank pretty similarly (which they do to me (I love making money as much as I love fucking over these people who hurt my hard working parents for trusting them)), then he would atleast say ""ok fair enough, instead he said (paraphrasing) 'you are a (r word), you know nothing, buy DOGE and we will all get rich', then he called me poor which i dont really get? I got on at 40 and have been buying since. 

The whole time they called me an imposter which, is r#$%\^ded because I am here, advocating that I am buying 2000$ more of gamestop tomorrow inorder to make my money of the infinite squeeze, money that is coming from the hedges, while he continues to promote his elon musk backed meme security crypto dogecoin, literally saying it will go to $5 (im no expert but im not sure thats how crypto works). 

TL;DR; Beware of discords saying they have ""replaced wallstreetbets"". There are many hedges AND INDIVIDUALS who have shorted the stock, but because of their greed, they didnt sell yesterday, or last week, now they are over their head. This is the same irresponsibility that lead to so many people getting hurt in 2008.

l6tdcq,Viince1,2021-01-28 10:16:54,GME," Opening remark: I am not a financial advisor. I eat crayons for lunch. Red ones are my favourite. Do not take this as financial advice. I like the stock. Posted this in /WSB but got banned. 

American Politics are trying to bail out their hedge fund friends to secure their campaign funding. There's been some speculation and pressure on SEC stepping in to intervene and save the pro's from their massive bleeding. Some propose to ""halt"" trading the stock to let it cool down ([https://www.barrons.com/articles/gamestop-trading-should-stop-for-30-days-says-state-securities-regulator-51611768563](https://www.barrons.com/articles/gamestop-trading-should-stop-for-30-days-says-state-securities-regulator-51611768563)).

Here's why I think this won't happen:

\- From what I can tell, when a short gets halted on trading the shorts contracts wont get executed but interest is still due ([https://ibkr.info/article/2880](https://ibkr.info/article/2880)).

\- Since the short borrowing rate is \~30% ([https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme)), this basically means that the hedge funds arre unable to get out of their position while they are still due massive interest for the full duration of trading halt. With the massive short interest (\~140%?). We know this will hurt Hedge Funds massively.

\- When the GME stock resumes being traded after 30 days, all of the short contracts need to get executed. This is basically a guarantee that we will see a gamma squeeze to the point where we rocket so hard and far into outer space, that WSB will be the first to establish contact with new life on new planets. WSB will then persuade extraterrestrial to help us buy GME stock. Wall Street fears this massively.

\- We already saw that even Citron is against the government stepping in because they know that they will be fucked even harder ( [https://twitter.com/CitronResearch/status/1354507447105327105?s=20](https://twitter.com/CitronResearch/status/1354507447105327105?s=20) ). They devoted their first political tweet on this. It's likely that they'll leverage their full lobbying power to prevent this from happening.

I believe we will not see SEC investigation on GME for the same motivation. If SEC investigates GME they WILL have to discover that the hedge funds went naked short and will cause even more damage to hedge funds and likely shift public opinion for the worse.

tl;dr

Not even white house can save hedge funds now. DO NOT SELL. Do not believe FUD. Keep diamond handing. GME 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

I tried to place an order at 300 but of course, it did not go through because the market is not open at 4AM.  As I understand it, my order will be automatically converted to a 'limit order' on Robinhood because it was placed while the market was closed.  Limit orders are canceled if the price increases 5% from the time you put in the order.  Since the price will increase far beyond 5% by the time market opens,

A) is my order essentially canceled already?

The short position on $GME is high. The highest on the market. But together, we are a force to be reckoned with. Millions of traders strong with billions💲collectively and more people are coming on board as we create waves.

I am committed to pushing this stock past $1,000 and towards $5,000. The higher we go, the more shorts have to close, and the more wealth we will relieve from hedge funds and investors looking to profit off the collapse of others.

We are redistributing wealth and as we rise together, each of us will have vastly more wealth to work with.

I propose that after we squeeze the shorts in $GME, we liberate capital from other companies. Nothing like this has ever happened before, and we have the opportunity to take money stagnating in funds that are fueling the destruction of the planet and incentivizing unnecessary suffering. We can take this wealth and use it appropriately, as a tool to make the world a better place.

We can reinvest in communities, progressive companies, visions and dreams, actions to make the world a better place, to minimize suffering and maximize meaningful opportunity and experience.

For far too long, wealth has been accumulated by the few at the cost of many. We can change that. Starting with $GME and then on to the next short shorts.

Now that they’re getting burned for it they are losing everything they have. That money is filling the pockets of millions of retail investors who believe GameStop is undervalue and, “like the stock”. For some unknown reason, robinhood chose to close off trading this morning for GameStop. Now, many of the retail investors are left watching from the sidelines while the hedge funds can still trade.

It appears they own the press such as CNBC which rolls one after the other members of establishment to threaten WSB. 

Now the SEC seems more than pleased to investigate while they allow HF and market makers the ability to Naked Short Sell GME under SEC loophole REG SHO (allows them to sell shares short and not borrow as in a traditional short sale). Stock Lending is very big business (ask Goldman Sachs). REG SHO uses liquidity as the excuse for allow 140% or more of all GME commons shares outstanding to be sold. This is what they have done with Novation Companies but for different reason, which is owned by Mass Mutual, Barings 18%, Fortress/EJF Capital 28% (also owns the only Sr Debt to exit Ch 11 April 2019) &amp; band of co investors own 32%.

Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn’t. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off).  Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it’s unlikely that it’s anyone at all.

Every single dip is caused by a mass selloff.

It's not WSB selling. Even if we were, it wouldn't make a BLIP in the share price.

DeepFuckingValue could sell right now and it wouldn't make a blip.

These dips are caused by the shorts trying to tank the price. They are selling borrowed shares. Again. To each other. They are doubling down. They are trying to scare you into selling.

Every share they sell is borrowed. It has to be repaid. They will need to buy it back and repay it.

Every dip is just another rise waiting to happen.

Look I love my car- but that doesn’t mean it’s worth 100k if it’s really worth 20k. Emotions don’t care about valuations. BUT— If you think it’s a dope company, then go buy it. BUT buy it because you believe it’s a money making enterprise— not because you’re emotional charged up... Better ways to expressive your emotion than losing your money. 

Good luck fellas— I just hope most of you don’t lose your savings money",Rule No.1 in stocks : NEVER GET EMOTIONAL!!

l72q8j,Several_Meet_8653,2021-01-28 17:14:05,GME,"The Melvin GME plan over the next few days! 

Melvin and his hedgefund buddies are selling and buying GME to eachother artificially dropping the price over and over, noone in this subreddit has the buying power to affect the markets like they have been affected.

Price dropped to below 120 for a while, now it's steadily up over 200 as I speak, but you need to bear in mind that melvin and his buddies are not finished! Considering the amount of money they have and how much stock price is going up and down and the fact that so many of us retail investors cannot actually buy any stock right now, the door is open for melvin and his buddy's to drive UP the price of GME stock. 
Only for them to get it up to 250/300  in the hopes that that will be high enough for many many of us to jump ship and sell GME. 

If this happens and we do sell and inevitably melvin and co. attempt to drop the price again, this may allow them to drop the price enough to save themselves tomorrow when their 50 million+ shares will be shorted and they'll be at the mercy of the markets!

If we all hold until tomorrow we all win and the hedgefunds lose for once.

This is David vs Goliath and they are going to try every trick in the book to encourage us all to sell, sure hell, look at the amount of bots that have infiltrated the subreddit and are desperately trying to encourage people to invest in other stocks.


They are doing all this in the hopes that the majority of us are out of the market before tomorrow so when the shorts are squeezed they don't lose billions and go bankrupt.

But fellow autists, if we stay in, it will be a historical day and we will have beaten Wall St. and we will all be alot richer because of it.

When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )
 
Too much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.
 
First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .
 
Official definition:
 
* Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted.
* Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question.
* A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.
 
Dumbed down version:
 
\- imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days.
 
\- Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""
 
Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/) = 6 days
 
[https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME](https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME) = 6.3 days
 
[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME) = 5.78 days
 
So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.
 
So what does that mean for us?
 
Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.
 
Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.
 
**Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!**
 
Now, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!
 
The only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking 138-140% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET. 
 
We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.
 
TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

Worse... you have betrayed millions of people who trusted you to Democratize the stonk market.

You have a chance to redeem yourself by doing the right thing

1. Immediately  Allow people to freely trade GME, AMC, NOK and any other stock you may  have restricted.  Do this now before the inevitable margin calls destroy  the investment of many of your users.
2. Eliminate margin calls for the next one week on the stocks whose purchase you halted.

Since it got removed: When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )
 
When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )
 
Too much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.
 
First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .
 
Official definition:
 
* Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted.
* Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question.
* A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.
 
Dumbed down version:
 
\- imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days.
 
\- Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""
 
Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/) = 6 days
 
[https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME](https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME) = 6.3 days
 
[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME) = 5.78 days
 
So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.
 
So what does that mean for us?
 
Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.
 
Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.
 
**Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!**
 
Now, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!
 
The only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking 138-140% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET. 
 
We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.
 
TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

l78dzz,Slimslade33,2021-01-28 20:50:05,GME,"Another post about why Gamestop is awesome and f\*&amp;k wallstreet.

People who didnt grow up rich and also grew up in the gamestop era remember how they made it accessable to play your favorite games. The ability to buy and sell used games is epic, and it is why gamestop is so special. I didnt have a game console growing up but I literaly would buy used games from gamestop so when I went to my friends houses I could play them. I remember in college my roommate had an Xbox and I immedietly went out and bought NBA 2k8 for like 20/30$ (2k9 just came out) as well as borderlands. It was awesome. Gamestop is a niche market that many people will never understand. Sure the times are changing and most games are digital but that does not mean that ALL people can buy a new 1000$ console and all the new games. some of us still use disks... For this reason I will always support gamestop. Due to trading being down on $GME $AMC $NOK I cannot buy more stocks but I will continue to support the cause... I recently bought a used Xbox one and was considering buying NBA2k21 but for nostalga sake and in light of everything i will revert to simpler times... Not to mention Gamestop also sells consols, digital games, accessories, toys, clothes and so much more. Its an awesome company and with the new (ish) CEO I wish them the best of luck for years to come... HOLD TO THE MOONN  #wallstreetbets #robinhood

Robinhood Financial LLC 85 Willow Road Menlo Park, CA 94025 United States

This    morning I, and millions of other retail investors, were blocked from    purchasing (entering new buy orders) on the Robinhood platform,  without   notice. This clear example of market manipulation has forced  the stock   down from over $500 in after-hours to less than $300 as of  this  writing.  Meanwhile, hedge fund interests are NOT blocked from  buying  the shares  being traded and the lower price obviously benefits  them.

We   retail investors have  followed all the rules and finally stood to gain  a  LITTLE bit from  Wall St and they suddenly change the rules ""to  protect""  us. I am  requesting you use your subpoena power and regulatory   authority to  examine whether Robinhood colluded illegally with any  other  actors who  may have held short positions on these stocks to  reduce the  number of  buyers for $GME and therefore deflate the price.  This is  market  manipulation.",Spreading some important info:

post about why Gamestop is awesome and f\*&amp;k wallstreet.

People who didnt grow up rich and also grew up in the gamestop era remember how they made it accessable to play your favorite games. I never owned a xbox/PS but once i had the money I remember buying used games so that I could play them at my friends house. In college I had a roommate who had an Xbox so I bought the previous version of NBA live (2008) as well as Borderlands it was fuckin epic! Now a days most games are digital and sure GME may seem obsolete but people who are not rich and dont have 50$ to spend on digital copies still use services like GME. Also they sell consols, acessories, toys, clothes and so much more. Not to mention they employ people all over the country!! Since #robinhood stalled trading on $GME, $AMC, and $NOK I decided to show my support in other ways!! HOLD THE LINE!!

l79lht,ConcededLoserTrunp,2021-01-28 21:35:25,GME,"markets become a voice for the voiceless. We’ve seen a new generation of people come into the markets, sparking conversations about what it means to be an investor. Our customers have shown the world that investing is for everyone—not just institutional investors and hedge funds.

Amid this week’s extraordinary circumstances in the market, we made a tough decision today to temporarily limit buying for certain securities. As a brokerage firm, we have many financial requirements, including SEC net capital obligations and clearinghouse deposits. Some of these requirements fluctuate based on volatility in the markets and can be substantial in the current environment. These requirements exist to protect investors and the markets and we take our responsibilities to comply with them seriously, including through the measures we have taken today.

Starting tomorrow, we plan to allow limited buys of these securities. We’ll continue to monitor the situation and may make adjustments as needed. 

To be clear, this was a risk-management decision, and was not made on the direction of the market makers we route to. 

We stand in support of our customers and the freedom of retail investors to shape their own financial future. Democratizing finance has been our guiding star since our earliest days. We will continue to build products that give more people—not fewer—access to our financial system. We’ll keep monitoring market conditions as we look to restore full trading for these securities. We will update this Help Center article with the latest changes. 

We are deeply grateful to our customers.",Robinhood GME

We saw 2 major moves in the prices (after market of course) in the last days, the price had a big pump in both cases.  
We know that they did this after market to avoid the hype during the market.  
For what i've understood, they're opening big longs too, in order to contain the losses and further manipulate the prices (if you drop a big long and open a short at the same time, the price will dip more).  
I mean, they have very skilled traders, it's clear that they are using very sophisticated techniques here.  
It's cristal clear that they replaced part of the expiring contracts with new ones, so the friday deadline is not entirely correct.  
So maybe we got the underlying concept (buy stocks) but we are wrong on the friday target, this could cause demoralization among us.  
We need to understand that if we want to win this war, we have to fight for long time.  
As far as the bulls buy stocks, the shorters are bleeding with their fees, but they can continue to short for a long time.  
We may need to review our strategy, maybe a more skilled trader than me can answer.  
I would like to have a wide debate about that and post it on WSB too, but i can't post there because i'm new.",Questions about the expiring short contracts

Ok.  I just want to point out they were probably the ones who pushed it up to 565 then bought puts at that level knowing that RH and other brokers were going to be out of commission this morning.  They were allow the full playbook while we got our arms tied behind our backs.   Clever of them.  Whatever.  

They knew there would be no volume buying back at then and then shook the tree dropping all the paper hands along the way.  Basically they sacrificed Robinhood for their billions that they made on that play and they picked up a shit load of commons.  What does that mean.  My guess is they bought themselves some extra time with that move.  Everyone keeps talking about Friday it will pop but that was pre today's drop.  They have ammo now thanks to some of you paper hands that will have to rebuy back in tomorrow.  

So I don't think this is going to pop now for much longer.  They did a cyber attack on Weds, Thursday broke SEC violations and took out their biggest competition with RH for volume which allowed them to knife without any resistance, and who knows what they try tomorrow.  Might send bag men to our houses.  

RH keep canceling my sell at 1200 order even though I have it sent until cancel thankfully most of my shares are safe at TD.  Shady stuff is going on.  

My point is use this anger.  I get paid tomorrow.  It's all going towards commons.  I don't care anymore about the money.  They got greedy and now are using all that money to change the rules when they get caught.  We lose our life savings and they get billions.  They lose billions....we bail them out.  Fuck them.   Holding forever.  My kids are getting these GME stocks.   

I LIKE THIS STOCK.  I LIKE GME.  I AM A POWERUP REWARDS MEMEMBER.  I actually believe RC can help them restructure to a more steam like digital platform and gaming centers with PC building and all that DD jazz.  

Lastly, I think this means this is going to drag on longer than tomorrow.  Be prepared for the long haul and more dirty tricks.  But they can pry my shares away from my cold dead 💎🧤 hands.

l7bsez,StockRecon,2021-01-28 23:02:35,GME,"**You must understand this Psych Ops War we're fighting against the Big Daddy Hedge Funds.**

**GameStop (GME) short squeeze has not even started yet!**

**Days-to-Cover:**  When the short squeeze begins and the big daddy Hedge Funds begin to buy stock to cover their Short Positions, **it will take them over 6 business trading days to get all of their buy orders filled** at the current day-to-day average volume that's trading in the open market every day.

If no one sells any stock to them, then **the Big Daddy Hedge Funds are SCREWED**!

**The elitist, filthy rich, arrogant Gordon Gekko's of the world are SCREWED!**

&amp;#x200B;

**Remember the law of Supply and Demand.**

If there is no Supply (stock) for them to buy (because none of us will sell it to them), then the lack of Supply will drive the price higher and higher due to the scarcity of shares available for them to buy.

So, **DO NOT SELL!**  

&amp;#x200B;

**WE ARE NOW IN A WAITING GAME!**   So, be patient!

**The first one to blink, loses.**  

&amp;#x200B;

As of today, **the Hedge Funds have borrowed** **122% of the Floating available shares of stock** in the marketplace which they then sold ""short"".   So those greedy bastards borrowed and sold 22% more shares than exist in the Float (aka, 122% of the Float is sold short). 

When they make their move to buy back shares to cover their short positions, they have to somehow, somewhere find 122% of the available float just to completely exit their positions.

**If none of us sell to them, then where are the Hedge Funds going to find 122% of the available shares in the Float to buy?**   The answer is they won't be able to find any.   ZERO!

The Hedge Funds only move now is to delay covering their short positions as long as possible in an attempt to wait us out.  

&amp;#x200B;

**They are now hoping to play a WAR OF ATTRITION.** 

The Hedge Funds want us to give up and sell our stock to them which will release them from their screwed predicament if they can convince us to sell.

**If none of us sell, and we keep buying, then the Hedge Funds are TRAPPED WITH NO WAY OUT!**

&amp;#x200B;

Remember the Hedge Funds are overleveraged on this trade and **borrowed money on Margin** (**aka, a margin loan)** from their Market Makers and Dealers in order to buy **122% of the Float** and then sell it short.

If we're patient, eventually the Market Makers and Broker Dealers will tell the Hedge Funds enough is enough, and they will DEMAND that the Hedge Funds immediately pay back the money they borrowed on Margin (aka, **a Margin Call**).  

That will force the Hedge Funds to begin to buy stock to cover their short positions.

**When that happens and only when that happens, the Short Squeeze will begin and then take at least 6 trading days for them to completely exit their short position at a major ""up the rear"" loss**.  

&amp;#x200B;

**It will be a blood bath for them!   Many go bankrupt in disgrace, outmaneuvered by a merry band of Robin Hood traders.**

We need to **Keep Buying and Keep Holding** until that happens.  

**BE PATIENT and HOLD!**

Keep buying if you can, like I am doing personally hand-over-fist.  I can't get enough of this stock!

&amp;#x200B;

**This will be THE EPIC MOTHER OF ALL SHORT SQUEEZES IN THE HISTORY OF THE MARKET!**

&amp;#x200B;

**The Hedge Funds will try to wait us out** and delay covering their short positions as long as possible hoping that we will give up and sell our stock to them so that they can then cover their short positions.

If no one sells (lack of supply for them to buy), then **the Law of Supply and Demand** **will push the price up, up, and up to the MOON and BEYOND!**

&amp;#x200B;

**IMPORTANT POINT to KNOW:**   **The Hedge Funds run in wolf packs.**  There will be a coordinated effort for them to attack and drive the price down temporarily in an attempt to get us to panic sell our stock to them so they may cover their shorts and limit their losses.   

**That's why we see some selling pressure today.  But** **it's not real and it won't last.**

**They're probing our Line to see if it will hold.**

That's why you're seeing false, fake news saying that Hedge Fund Melvin has already covered and exited his position and the game is over.   But that's **a damn lie!**   If Hedge Fund Melvin had covered, then there would not still be **122% shares sold short** out of the available float.  So **don't believe what you read or hear on CNBC.** 

&amp;#x200B;

**Some of the Hedge Funds still have some stock on their books which they're selling today to drive the price down in an attempt to panic us and shake us out of our positions.**

&amp;#x200B;

**This is Psych-Ops warfare at its finest!**

&amp;#x200B;

They're not going to give up easily, but if we hold the line and don't sell, then eventually they will receive **Margin Calls from their Broker Dealers** from whom they borrowed the money to originally buy the stock that they then sold short late last year.  That will be the beginning of the end.

The Hedge Funds will attempt to delay their Broker Dealer's Margin Calls and roll out their positions to a later expiration date.  But that only goes out so far before this war is over.

**If we're patient and continue to hold, then Sooner or Later their Broker Dealers will deliver their Margin Calls which will force the Hedge Funds to buy stock to close out their positions before it gets worse and worse the higher the price goes up.**  

&amp;#x200B;

**My guess is that this war will be over during the next 1-3 weeks or sooner depending on when the Hedge Funds receive their Margin Calls from their Broker Dealers.**

Eventually as we continue to buy and not sell,  the price will keep ratcheting up so high, that their Brokers Dealers will cry ""Uncle"" and run out of patience and force the Hedge Funds to buy stock to cover (aka, a Margin Call).  

That Margin Call can occur at any time.

And then it will take over 6 trading days for them to completely exit their losing positions (aka, Days-to-Cover).

&amp;#x200B;

**Meanwhile due to lack of available supply to buy, the price will go to the Moon and beyond!**

So HOLD THE LINE and KEEP BUYING!  

As a block of independent WSB traders, we collectively control billions of dollars of buying power.  

We're collectively as big a player as most of the big Hedge Funds.

&amp;#x200B;

**DO NOT SELL UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES until the price gets over +&gt;$2,000 per share!**

When GME is over $2,000 per share, then you may sell only 20% of your position to lock in some gain and then let the rest **continue to ride higher, and higher, and higher up to Valhalla !!!**

Please take it from this former U.S. Marine and hold until they unconditionally surrender to us and we completely gut them and we eat their hearts and livers.

**This is WAR!**    **FIGHT ON BROTHERS AND SISTERS, FIGHT ON!**

**Aaaaarugha!**

l7d63d,600300,2021-01-29 00:00:00,GME,"30 Seconds From Triggering Market Nuclear Bomb

I'm glad this place has quieted down enough for some actual DD written by a monkey with a keyboard and Adderall.  

Disclaimer: I am that monkey.  Let me explain to you what happened, play by play.  I will give you illiterates who hate reading a spoiler up front: 

__We were within approximately 30 seconds of triggering a nuclear bomb that would have blown up the market.__ Do I have your attention?  Here goes:

1.	⁠Yesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570.  Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again?  Really?  We've been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock.  This creates upwards pressure on the market.  We've been seeing these movements all week.
2.	⁠Yesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and spook retail investors into a mass sell-off.  It didn't work.
3.	⁠Last night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options.  You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so.  Very interesting and the first sign of pants-shitting fear.
4.	⁠Today, the market opened very strong.  It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570.
5.	⁠At approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move.
6.	⁠Two minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling.
7.	⁠The trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.

Okay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this: The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it.  What does that mean?  It means they ran out of shares and/or capital. They wouldn't let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market.  

__I saw an unsubstantiated post from a user who said a small sell limit order executed at $2600 for him.  Do you get the severity of the situation, if that's true?__ It means the buying was getting to the point where it was just about to put INFINITE pressure on the price of the shares.  It means virtually any ask was getting bid.

How do you get infinite upwards pressure?  A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted.  The call writers need shares to hedge.  Retail is still buying more.  The short sellers need over 100% of the float back.  Add these together.  There were more shares needed than existed on the open market.  That's what a liquidity crisis is.

[Listen to this ](https://youtu.be/7RH4XKP55fM)to this remarkable (if infuriating) interview where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn't have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home.  DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO ""PROTECT THE MARKET""? Hello!  He's not talking about the market for GME shares.  He's talking about the entire market!  The New York Stock Exchange.  The NASDAQ.  All that.

Remember the movie Snowpiercer?  Do you remember that scene where the lower class people realize the soldiers who oppress them have no bullets?  Go to the 1:00 minute mark of this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o

It kick starts a full blown rebellion.  They have no bullets.  It's the exact same in this market:  No capital.  No shares.  Infinite losses inbound.

__TL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, ""Do I get my tendies now?"" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares.  Do you get that?  HOLD.  Like the guy in the movie, scream, ""They're out of bullets!"" and create a stampede.  That's how we win.__

They needed your shares so badly that they literally risked PRISON TIME to get them.  They tried robbing you, and I'm not even exaggerating.  They were within 30 seconds of all being wiped out today.

l7dg4s,PlayFree_Bird,2021-01-29 00:10:59,GME,"I put the following on r/WallStreetBets, but I can share it here, too.

- - - - - - 

I'm glad this place has quieted down enough for some actual DD written by a monkey with a keyboard and Adderall.  Disclaimer: I am that monkey.  Let me explain to you what happened, play by play.  I will give you illiterates who hate reading a spoiler up front: **We were within approximately 30 seconds of triggering a nuclear bomb that would have blown up the market.** Do I have your attention?  Here goes:

1. Yesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570.  Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again?  Really?  We've been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock.  This creates upwards pressure on the market.  We've been seeing these movements all week.

2. Yesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and spook retail investors into a mass sell-off.  It didn't work.

3. Last night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options.  You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so.  Very interesting and the first sign of pants-shitting fear.

4. Today, the market opened very strong.  It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570.

5. At approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move.

6. Two minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling.

7. The trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.

Okay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this: **The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it.**  What does that mean?  It means they ran out of shares and/or capital.  They wouldn't let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market.  I saw an unsubstantiated post from a user who said **a small sell limit order executed at $2600 for him.**  Do you get the severity of the situation, if that's true?  It means the buying was getting to the point where it was just about to put INFINITE pressure on the price of the shares.  It means virtually any ask was getting bid.

How do you get infinite upwards pressure?  A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted.  The call writers need shares to hedge.  Retail is still buying more.  The short sellers need over 100% of the float back.  Add these together.  There were more shares needed than existed on the open market.  That's what a liquidity crisis is.

Listen to [this remarkable (if infuriating) interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RH4XKP55fM) where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn't have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home.  **DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO ""PROTECT THE MARKET""?** Hello!  He's not talking about the market for GME shares.  He's talking about the entire market!  The New York Stock Exchange.  The NASDAQ.  All that.

Remember the movie *Snowpiercer*?  Do you remember that scene where the lower class people realize the soldiers who oppress them have no bullets?  Go to the 1:00 minute mark of this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o

It kick starts a full blown rebellion.  They have no bullets.  It's the exact same in this market:  No capital.  No shares.  Infinite losses inbound.

**TL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, ""Do I get my tendies now?"" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares.  Do you get that?  HOLD.  Like the guy in the movie, scream, ""They're out of bullets!"" and create a stampede.  That's how we win.**  

They needed your shares so badly that they literally risked PRISON TIME to get them.  They tried robbing you, and I'm not even exaggerating.  They were within 30 seconds of all being wiped out today.",PLEASE UNDERSTAND why Robinhood pulled the stunt they did today. The big money shorts are out of shares and out of capital. We were on the cusp of triggering a full-blown infinite squeeze. The nuclear bomb of squeezes.

So I noticed some very strange activity having with heavy OOTM puts on GME the past few days. Activity that seems so strange I can't believe that it would be an actual human… or maybe just a 🌈🐻 from the future. My RH account only had $3.12 in it because I YOLO'd everything away in spectacular retarded fashion back in March with the beer virus.

Anyway, I still wanted to test my theory. The other day I bought a GME 2/19 PUT @ $2 for $0.03 and I've been fishing with crazy sell orders. I placed a sell order at $10. Someone (or something) just bought it at close.

It's really too late to buy Long CALLS on GME right now.   The Implied Volatility (IV) is way too high at 823% IV which makes the cost of the options way too expensive.   To compare, the Historical Volatility (HV) averaged 349% during the last 30 days.  So the high IV makes the option prices too expensive.

Only buy the actual shares of GME to avoid the IV crush in the options when the option IV collapses and drives the price of options lower.   In simple terms, a collapse in the option IV basically has zero affect on the price of the stock.

I put the following on r/WallStreetBets, but I can share it here, too.

- - - - - - 

I'm glad this place has quieted down enough for some actual DD written by a monkey with a keyboard and Adderall.  Disclaimer: I am that monkey.  Let me explain to you what happened, play by play.  I will give you illiterates who hate reading a spoiler up front: **We were within approximately 30 seconds of triggering a nuclear bomb that would have blown up the market.** Do I have your attention?  Here goes:

1. Yesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570.  Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again?  Really?  We've been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock.  This creates upwards pressure on the market.  We've been seeing these movements all week.

2. Yesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and spook retail investors into a mass sell-off.  It didn't work.

3. Last night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options.  You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so.  Very interesting and the first sign of pants-shitting fear.

4. Today, the market opened very strong.  It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570.

5. At approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move.

6. Two minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling.

7. The trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.

Okay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this: **The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it.**  What does that mean?  It means they ran out of shares and/or capital.  They wouldn't let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market.  I saw an unsubstantiated post from a user who said **a small sell limit order executed at $2600 for him.**  Do you get the severity of the situation, if that's true?  It means the buying was getting to the point where it was just about to put INFINITE pressure on the price of the shares.  It means virtually any ask was getting bid.

How do you get infinite upwards pressure?  A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted.  The call writers need shares to hedge.  Retail is still buying more.  The short sellers need over 100% of the float back.  Add these together.  There were more shares needed than existed on the open market.  That's what a liquidity crisis is.

Listen to [this remarkable (if infuriating) interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RH4XKP55fM) where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn't have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home.  **DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO ""PROTECT THE MARKET""?** Hello!  He's not talking about the market for GME shares.  He's talking about the entire market!  The New York Stock Exchange.  The NASDAQ.  All that.

Remember the movie *Snowpiercer*?  Do you remember that scene where the lower class people realize the soldiers who oppress them have no bullets?  Go to the 1:00 minute mark of this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o

It kick starts a full blown rebellion.  They have no bullets.  It's the exact same in this market:  No capital.  No shares.  Infinite losses inbound.

**TL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, ""Do I get my tendies now?"" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares.  Do you get that?  HOLD.  Like the guy in the movie, scream, ""They're out of bullets!"" and create a stampede.  That's how we win.**  

They needed your shares so badly that they literally risked PRISON TIME to get them.  They tried robbing you, and I'm not even exaggerating.  They were within 30 seconds of all being wiped out today.","Read read, share share my game stop soldiers"

l7gytq,StockRecon,2021-01-29 02:47:42,GME,"**Listen up Troops this is important!**

Just so you know where we're taking the price of GME stock, let's compare this to another stock.

**Berkshire Hathaway Inc**. class A stock shares (NYSE Symbol:  BRK.A) c**urrently sells for $348,220 per share.**    Warren Buffet who is the 4th richest man in the world is the founder and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Berkshire Hathaway, Inc.

That's not a typo!

**BRK.A sells for $348,220 per share** on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)

Look up the price and check it out for yourself.

Just type ""**BRK.A**"" into your stock search engine and you'll see the price.

&amp;#x200B;

**If we HOLD THE LINE, then we can push GME up to that price too!**

**There is nothing that can stop us.**

Those of you who want to settle for only $1,000 per share are retarded.  

Do Not Sell and settle for that ridiculously low price!

&amp;#x200B;

**The Hedge Funds are Trapped**.    **The Short Squeeze has not yet begun.**

GME currently has 46,890,000 shares in their Float.  So let's call it **47 million shares in their Float.**

**Those greedy, arrogant, filthy rich Hedge Funds borrowed and sold 126% of that Float** **which equates to 59,220,000 million shares they borrowed and sold short!**

&amp;#x200B;

In order to unwind and close their losing position, **the Hedge Funds need to Buy back 59 million shares to close out their position!**

**Now where are they ever going to find 59 million shares to buy if none of us sell to them?**

The answer is they won't be able to find them to close out their position!  They're screwed.

&amp;#x200B;

The Hedge Funds are TRAPPED because of all of the millions of shares that we collectively own and refuse to sell to them.  There are not enough shares for them to buy to cover their shorts.

Eventually their Broker Dealers who originally loaned the greedy Hedge Funds the money to borrower 59 million shares that they don't own to then sell short will eventually cry ""Uncle"" , enough is enough, and t**heir Broker Dealers will demand the Hedge Funds pay back the money they borrowed** (aka, **a Margin Call**).   It may take a week or two for this to happen, but it will indeed happen.

**The Margin Call will force the Hedge Funds to sell everything they own to raise the money to pay back their Margin Call** including forcing them to sell their billions of dollars of assets, their real estate, stocks, bonds, gold, crypto... everything those bastards own will be sold to raise the money to satisfy the Margin Call.  They'll be forced to sell their beach home in the Hamptons, their Lamborghini, their Ferrari, their Land Rovers, their yachts, their Gulf Stream jets, their mountain homes at the ski resort, their beach home in Palm Beach, their Rolex watches, their wives' diamonds, the gold fillings in their teeth, and their Armani suits and Gucci shoes.  And yes, we're also going to take their socks.

  
**They are Screwed as long as we Hold the Line and don't sell any of our stock to them.**

The lack of supply of available stock for them to buy that is needed to close their position will push the price of GME higher and higher all of the way up to **$348,000 per share**.   As long as we hold the line!

WE MUST HOLD THE LINE!

**If the price of Berkshire Hathaway class A stock (BRK.A) sells for $348,000 per share, then there is nothing that prevents us from pushing GME stock price up to match that price.**

Nothing can stop us!

&amp;#x200B;

If one person can do it, then so can we.  If Warren Buffet can push the price of his Berkshire Hathaway stock that high, then so can we!

**If BRK.A sells for $348,000 per share, then we can and we will push GME up to that price too!**

&amp;#x200B;

Keep buying, and buying, and buying.  And then buy some more and then HOLD THE LINE.

**This Psych Ops War is an EPIC battle between Big Daddy Warbucks and us!**  

And together we're making History.

&amp;#x200B;

**SHIELD WALL UP and HOLD THE LINE!**

**We're taking GME up to $348,000 per share!**

Aaaarugha!

The end is here. Old game must stop, new game rule is coming.  
If you want to see the miracle, then read this article.

The      previous article I have talked about how to kick-off the global      financial reset event, then this post it is about how to defeat the      current financial structure and change the international financial      system to the right direction.

**What is the major flaws of the current economic financial system?**  
It is about how the money was “printed” and “distributed”.  
Now all the money was created and controled only by the central banks and top government, it is 100%.  
The     money was distributed based on “gambling” and “feeling” rather than      fairness. If it was correct then it is ultra correct, if it wrong  then     it is super wrong !  
Who are those beings/entities decide? Just bunch of mortal humans so they always make mistakes.

If      you want to defeat and change the current financial system for the      better, fairer for all, then all you need is to focus on those major      flaws &amp; loophole.

**So how to defeat?**  
All you need to do is set a fixed amount of % money distribution to the society to a fair amount.  
**Example:** out of $100 dollar, how much each entities will receive:  
\- Top government: $50-60 dollar (50-60%).

\- Local authority: $20-30 dollar (20-30%).  
\- Individual people group: $10-20 dollar (10-20%).  
The number can be changed as the by each period of 50-60 years or more up to agreement.

The top government here is the current one who are decide 100% of how the money is distributed to the public.  
The local authority here could mean the “state” or “district” government based on each nations.  
The     individual group here mean every single real organic human was born     in  that district/state/nation and must speak that local language      fluently.

**Global Financial System 1:**

In      order to join the system, all nations must put an fair amount of     “land”  or “assets” to the table which is at least 50% of other nations     agree.  You can call this as trust guarantee assets.

**Minimum requirement:** Nation must have at least 0.1% of the total world population.  
**Money type:** only 1 type of currency.  
**Period:** 60 years.

**Maximum money printed cap per person:** $1 million US Dollar or fixed amount of gold/silver/bronze value.

\*You      can print endless money but if any nations reached that cap, then   you    will out of the system and lost the “land” or “assets” you have   put  to   the table.  
**Minimum base money rate:** 1:1 on all nations. Or any rate but it must set at the start of the game.  
The     limit threshold will be 1:1000, which mean if any nation value drop      1000 times since the game start, then you are out of the game too.

**Money distribution rule will be fixed:**      top government 50-60%, local authority 20-30%, individual people    group   10-20%. (Apply on every single 100 dollar or so). The extract    number   will be decided by either coin toss or dice luck, all months    are not the   same number. The money paper designed must be agreed by    the rest. The   total money has printed to the society must be updated    once every  month.

The  top    government still  have all ultimate rights about rule about how the     money coming in and  out, as long as tax, restrictions, etc.

In      order to make the game more interesting, you can have some end   period    rule such as after every 60 years, the bottom 10 nations who   have    printed the most money to the public will be the losers and lost   their    entire trust guarantee assets on the table, and it will be   taken by the    top 10 nations or random distributed to the people.

**Global Financial System 2:**  
All nations will allowed to join freely.  
**Money type:** domestic and international currency.  
**Money distribution:**      domestic currency will decided by the authority, while the      international currency will decide random factors and direct to the      public people.  
This system I have talked briefly before, so you can      re-read those specific article again, I do not want to repeat and   waste    time here.

Beside those    domestic  and international money, you  can have digital money currency    and  physical money. But that will be  more complicated issues and I    don’t  think this civilization have yet  ready.  
It is about objective of what you want to archive with the new systems.  
If     you just want to end economy trade war, solve the climate change and      migration problems then all you need is just 2 system above.

I      do believe my idea and solution is well worth a lot of wealth, so   you    can send the donation to my cryptocurrency wallet bellow:

Have you ever built a computer in order to play games? I definitely have. There’s a company by the name of NewEgg that helps me order PC parts for my gaming rig. Maybe you’ve heard of NewEgg as well. It’s a billion dollar company. They currently don’t have a stock on the Nasdaq, but they will soon. They are most likely going to merge with a small million dollar company on the nasdaq entitled LLIT.

Back story, my car was stolen out of my driveway. Insurance company compensated me some money. I've been lurking on WSB and GME, but never actively posted, or commented. I saw DFVs posts, and at this point I have no clue about investing. I researched, I learned about what he's been saying. I decided to use the money and invested it in GME. 

Having seen the stock go up and down has pretty much gave me stress diarrhea for the past week. Deficiently needed some Gatorade today.  

There were times after initial couple of days, I was about to sell as soon as it dipped. I held out and diamond handed. I've always promised my parents since 14 that one day, I'd be able to buy them a car. This morning, I thought I'd be finally able to. However, after what happened today, I'm fully committed and want to see this through. 

Did not sell. Still holding! Even wife knows about my diamond hand! I hope I don't have to walk to work everyday 

Glad to be part of this! 🚀🚀",Thanks Guys!
l7hzv6,s8onic,2021-01-29 03:33:58,GME,"A lot of the discussion today has been on brokerage apps shutting retailers out and how Robinhood especially is now cancelled. However, I don't see any discussion on what caused the huge dip this morning. I was wondering what were the full implications of what happened? Here are some thoughts I have read:

* The price dipped way too quickly and each dip caused a market halt. Afterwards it rebounded way too quickly as well for it to be have caused by retailers. Supposedly one effect of this was to scare retailers to paperhanding.

* As mentioned in this post: 13,000 OTM Weekly Calls for 570 were bought at the lowest dip. Given that Robinhood and many other brokerage apps were banning GME and options, this means that institutions were buying these, likely to hedge short positions.

So my question is, does anybody have any theories besides these why the orchestrated dip occurred? How did they orchestrate the dip: Was it through more shorting, or one firm have a bunch of stocks ready to mass sell? Could they have covered older short positions, while creating new ones at a higher price? Could some other tomfoolery have been occurring. While I am balls deep in GME as well (900 shares), these hedge funds have smart people and part of me thinks they've been able to slowly work through an exit strategy.",Discussion: What caused the massive dip today and what were the motives behind it?

l7iy81,TruthHurtsLessThan,2021-01-29 04:17:59,GME,"CNBC and pro hedge fund politicians completely ignore the fact that GME was manipulated to 2.30 per share by attacks made by hedgefund ""quants"". How do they know the price of GME isn't the fair evaluation. If an individual investor freely buys a share at whatever price. It's completely their choice to justify the price paid. 

Check with the SEC it is up to investors who freely trade in both BUYING and SELLING in a stock and whatever price reflected is the price.

Here is some insight to how a hedge fund will trade :
They have a closed door meeting where they decide which public company to manipulate and make their next big payday.

When a hedge fund trades it takes a short position then creates a series of sell order tranches at lower intervals 1000 shares for 20, then 2000 shares for 19, and so on to forcefully drive a stock down or buy orders to make a price rise; this is MANIPULATION. 

When they then reach their target price they stop the manipulation and place call options because they know now that they no longer manipulate the stock IT will naturally rise back up and when it does they exercise their call options and cash out twice.

What these hedge funds do with billions of dollars. Subreddit wallstreetbets did with a computer and motivated individuals. No manipulation on the side of individual investors. We all chose freely with publicly available information to BUY and HOLD GME.

But I'm curious what do you call forcefully limiting the BUYING feature of trades and only allow SELLING. imagine I placed the same restriction with the real estate industry. It would crash instantly.

I’m completely new to stocks. My experience goes as far as watching the Wolf of Wall Street.

I made a silly error. The app I used in the UK is Captiol. They have what I believe is ‘margin loaning’. I deposited £500 as I thought that was the minimum and bought one share. I sold after a mere £40 profit. I then bought 4 shares thinking I just bought one again (I didn’t even have enough for 4 shares but the app loaned me the money apparently). When that horrific crash happened it fell so much the app automatically sold as I didn’t have the balance to cover the losses. I thought I went back in at one share.

In 15 mins I went from 500 to 45. Now I know this my fault through my lack of knowledge. My intention was to buy one share and hopefully see a small win. I earn minimum wage and just wanted a small £100 win or something while sticking it to Wall Street.

Through the same system I now have one stock. If it drops to £160 it will auto sell and I’ve lost the full £500. If it rises even to today’s peak I already get half my money back. 

Tomorrow, I’m desperate. I went in this happy to loose £150 and didn’t realise that was being multiplied by 4. I know it’s relatively small but to me that’s my entire rent.

So tomorrow, what likely gonna happen? If it starts to rise and I can get most my money back I’m a happy man. What’s the game plan if you was me? I see it’s rising overnight, will the big gain tomorrow happen when it opens? If so I can just watch it happen, sell and be back to normal. If it initially dips I’m fucked as my share will sell and then I won’t catch the rise. Desperate for advice!",Advice for a fool

I've worked shitty jobs since 16. I've had to forego a car since I left home at 18, as the car insurance in my icy island province (Newfoundland) is so high for young men that it's unaffordable for many.

I turn 25 soon. This is my final term of school, and after this I'll be getting a salaried position and I'll financially stable for the first time in my life.

But in the meantime, this is the poorest I've ever been. Until May, my diet is restricted to $120/mo (food is expensive on an icy island) and my girlfriend and I will be foregoing dates, alcohol, and other expensive things until then.

I'm not selling at $500, despite the fact that it would alleviate next month's rent, and allow me to get some real food.

I'm not selling at $1k either, even though that could cover the cost of a car lease and a few months of insurance. No, fuck you, I'll continue walking through the snow and ice until this moons.

l7mbv8,StockRecon,2021-01-29 07:19:13,GME,"  **Where we’re at right now at 10pm Pacific Standard Time on 28 January 2021**

After a prolonged coordinated counter attack by the Bid Daddy Hedge Funds today who repeatedly tried to crash the price, GameStop (GME) closed regular trading hours at **$193.60**. During the day the trading range bounced all over the place between $112.25 all of the way up to $483.00 at the high of the day.

In after-hours trading, **GME has now rebounded up to $311.99** where it’s at right now ready to catapult higher when the market opens again tomorrow morning.

&amp;#x200B;

**It became common knowledge today that the Robin Hood trading platform is allegedly in bed with their primary Broker Dealer, Citadel Securities.** 

Citadel Securities loaned Melvin Hedge Fund $2.75 Billion yesterday to keep them solvent and buy them enough time to attempt to crash the price and panic us to sell our stock to them on the cheap.

**Robin Hood halted all buy orders on GME today**. And that is outrageous!

They would only allow us to sell GME stock, but not buy any new shares. A skeptical person would ask if their overlord Citadel Securities had anything to do with their halt of trading on GME?  And count me in as a very skeptical person with this regard. 

The halt in trading allowed the Hedge Funds to mount a counter attack and sell what little stock they do own to drive the price down in the hope of panicking us to mistakenly sell our shares  “before we lose everything”. 

**This was one big head-fake**.  And we’re too smart to let that happen.

They were playing us for fools and that failed gambit was all one big pile of horse manure. 

&amp;#x200B;

**We HELD THE LINE!**  So, walk tall and be proud today Troopers. We successfully defended against their 2nd attack in the last two days.

Today, because Robin Hood screwed us and halted trading on GME, the Hedge Funds got a chance to buy some of the stock they needed and they reduced their short position from 140% of the Float down to 126% of the Float.

**THEIR COUNTER ATTACK FAILED!** **Because we held the line!**

&amp;#x200B;

Even though they reduced some of their exposure, **the Hedge Funds are still over-subscribed and are still short 126% of the Float**. 

What does that mean?

**It means to fully exit their short position, the Hedge Funds still need to buy another 59 million shares of GME.** Yikes!

How do we get that number?  Just take 126% of the Float of 46.89 million shares = 59 million shares they still need to buy to close out their short position. 

You can look up the number of shares in GME Float and the percent that are shorted at finance.yahoo.com/Statistics and enter the stock symbol GME.

And where are the Hedge Funds going to find that many shares to buy? 

No Where. That’s where.  No where. 

We collectively control a massive chunk of those needed shares.

And guess what? 

We’re not going to sell them any of ours, and there is no place else they can go to buy them.

&amp;#x200B;

**Today changed nothing.**

**THE HEDGE FUNDS ARE STILL TRAPPED AND TOTALLY SCREWED!**

**And best of all, The MOTHER OF ALL SHORT SQUEEZES HAS NOT EVEN STARTED YET!**

Today was just another counter attack that failed, and there will be more we will have to defend and more that we will successfully defend because we are all Holding the Line.

Our efforts to fight back and crush those elitist, arrogant, filthy rich Hedge Funds have gone viral around the world. So, literally hundreds of thousands if not millions of little guys from around the world are piling into this trade and buying, buying, and buying more shares tomorrow and throughout next week until the Short Squeeze begins. 

&amp;#x200B;

**This has become an EPIC class warfare**. 

The **Filthy Rich Elitists** who think they’re better than everyone else **versus** a rag tag army of **Working Class Heroes.**

David versus Goliath!

As more and more little guys jump into battle with us, we will push the price up, up, and up higher all the way to Alpha Centauri!

&amp;#x200B;

**Price Target**

I mentioned in my last post that **the class A stock of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) currently sells for $343,450.00 per share at the close of the market today.** 

**That is our price target for GameStop (GME).** 

**That’s not a typo.** **You read it correctly.**

**$343,450 per share is our price target.**

Why not? 

If Warren Buffet who is the founder of Berkshire Hathaway can drive the price of his stock up to $343,450, then so can we. 

Check it out for yourself and enter a stock search for “**BRK.A**” and you’ll see the closing price of Berkshire Hathaway class A shares. That’s where we’re going.

&amp;#x200B;

**Where to Buy More Shares**

Robin Hood screwed us today and allegedly sided with Citadel Securities to shut down trading.

Robin Hood was never our friend. They advertised free trades, but our trades were never really free.

Behind the scenes, Robin Hood was quietly selling our “order flow data” to Citadel Securities and other Broker Dealers who were then allegedly front running our purchases and scalping pennies, nickels, and dimes off of each of our trades times millions and millions of trades that added up to Billions of Dollars of profits for them. 

Nothing is for free. Robin Hood makes a fortune from selling our order flow data to the Broker Dealers who then fill our purchase orders for a little bit more than we would pay at another brokerage firm. Just like Facebook sells our personal data behind the scenes. Robin Hood does the same thing only with our order flow data.

Tomorrow, I suggest you consider opening a new trading account with any of the major brokerage firms. You can go online and open a new account and wire money into it within minutes and you’ll be up and running.

The large brokerage firms never halted trading GME today except when the price swings hit the breaker switch and trading across all platforms was temporarily halted for 15 minutes cooling off periods to calm the trading. Then trading resumed again.

I had no trouble getting my orders filled at Fidelity Investments today and I hear others like Charles Schwab, E\*Trade, TD Ameritrade, Merrill Lunch and others all kept trading today. They all allow commission free online trading, and mobile app trading.

I am not an investment broker and this is not investment advice, but merely a suggestion to shop around for a more reputable brokerage firm if you’re not happy with the one you’re using.

&amp;#x200B;

As I posted in my previous blogs, **once the Short Squeeze begins, it will take over 6 trading days at the current average daily trading volumes for the Hedge Funds to locate, and bid on, and buy 59 million shares to close their positions**. So, there is still plenty of time to keep building your position.

Just one last word of caution.  **Please don’t invest any more than you can afford to lose.**

&amp;#x200B;

Rest up tonight, because this **Epic Psych Ops Warfare** resumes early tomorrow morning in pre-hour trading. 

My personal plan for me is to keep on buying and buying and buying and then HOLD until we hit our price target of **$343,450 per share**.

&amp;#x200B;

When this is all done and we’ve thoroughly defeated our opponents, they’ll be writing songs and making movies and telling tales around the camp fires about this one epic time in history when **a rag tag army of Working Class Heroes crushed the Titans of Wall Street** and bankrupt all of those greedy bastards and made them cry.

**This will be the Greatest Transfer of Wealth from the Rich to the Poor in the History of the World!**

&amp;#x200B;

**THIS IS AN EPIC BATTLE between GOOD versus EVIL !**

&amp;#x200B;

I’ll proudly meet you all on the battle field tomorrow and stand shoulder to shoulder with you with our **SHIELD WALLS UP** to **HOLD the LINE**... 

Blessings to you all !

Semper Fi",Today Changed Nothing. We Held the Line. And it's not too late to buy more GME stock.

l7mw8q,StockRecon,2021-01-29 07:53:45,GME,"Update:

A back of the napkin calculation for Days to Cover the short for the Hedge Funds:

[FinViz.com](https://FinViz.com) shows 50,650,000 shares in the Float with 122% short = 61,793,000 shares short x average volume of 25,610,000  = 2.41 days to cover.

Yahoo! Finance numbers compute to 4.9 days to cover.

So the days to short is approximately somewhere between 2.41 to 4.9 days to cover right now which averages 3.65.

I know that it will never be forgotten and that it will change the market for ever so it keeps me moving forward.

l7po3s,eviltr4d3r,2021-01-29 10:50:15,GME,"Fellow Hodors, Spartans and retards,

There are a lot of rumours out there and after researching a lot I will do my best to share my opinion on the situation and my plan. Please read.

## Current Context

As of few days, there are still **60 million+ shorted stocks**. This means that **millions of stocks are shorted NAKED** (no one lend them the stock to sell it (short it), which is only legal under very specific context).

https://preview.redd.it/clijujig49e61.png?width=339&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d83bb3fb9809786a7fa95223ef34c0f02466b813

You must know that Melvin and other wales can hold their stock for long time BUT they are bleeding money with every day that passes.

If you learn one thing from this post, this should be it: &gt;!There is no way they can close those 60 million!&lt;. **There are just not enough stocks available, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO GET OUT OF THE POSITION.**

&gt;!The Stock price is irrelevant!&lt;\*\*, even at 17$\*\* they are unable to close their position and **IF WE HOLD** the **squeeze inevitably will happen SOONER OR LATER**

As of my math, retailers (like me) we own easy 20million + stock, and some wales in our side + owners are probably  an extra 20 million stocks.

**That makes the available float to be \~25 million.** &gt;!Do you understand how fucked they are now and why they need you to sell?!&lt;

## Melvin's and shorters gameplay

Taking those things into account, Melvin and other will try to make us believe that:

1. The short squeeze has already happened
2. Must happen today (Friday 29th) or wont happen
3. Show that is not possible because they keep pushing the price down and that makes the short squeeze impossible
4. Destroy your stamina and hope by raising and pushing the price down

None of that is true.

THINK!!! Many brokers have stopped allowing you to purchase because they are in heavy danger of being forced to close the position. None of this would have happened if we were not winning.

## But when will the squeeze happen then?

When they are forced to close. And there are few things that will force their hand to close.

1. Margin call

* If the price raises too much they will be forced to close, regardless of what they want. Gamma squeeze (assigned call options at expiration + Market Makers forced to buy more and more stocks as the price raises to cover purchased calls) + BUYS and HOLD will keep reducing available stocks pushing the price UP. This will speed up by a lot a margin call forcing them to close. **This can take days or few weeks, depending on how fast the price raises.**

1. Liquidity call -  Non payable interests

* Short positions must pay interest. They can hold their position if the price doesn't snow ball BUT they will keep loosing millions every time they have to pay interest. Don't get me wrong. **If they can keep the price down we will need to wait several weeks or months before they run out of money.**

## What am I going to do in the next days / weeks / months

Pure and simple. BUY and HOLD.

Use dips to lower my average price. Keep removing float from the market and keep pushing pressure on the short positions.

Don't let anyone fool you. The squeeze will and can happen at any price. A high price will only make it happen sooner.

**Do not sell**. That is the only reason why a squeeze might not happen.

## My Broker and my specific actions from EUROPE

My broker is IBKR. His owner ([Thomas Peterffy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Peterffy)) has admitted a crime on television, stating that he could not let the price snowball and that people is buying a stock that should be worth $17 at $300. This is market manipulation, raw and simple and he should go to jail. 

Moving on, this is personal for me now. FUCK THE MONEY and the GAINS. I AM NOT GOING TO FUCKING SELL because IT IS MY FUCKING RIGHT. 

I was not planning into risking more money but that has completely change now after yesterday 's global market manipulation.

I got my salary yesterday, and those 4k+ are going straight into GME. I have a new account with **Ninety Nine** that allows me to buy GME. 

Please, understand that I do not recommend anyone to do this. I have a personal situation that allows me to hold the position for months and keep throwing money at it. 

Do not follow my strategy 'cos you read it in a post in reddit. Be responsible about your financial situation, about what you think is going to happen and act accordingly. 

&amp;#x200B;

They have done a fucking huge mistake. They have made a money matter a personal and rights matter and now I am pissed the fuck off.

l7qkza,teataster007,2021-01-29 11:45:19,GME,"First off, I don’t know what I am doing and this is not financial advice.

&amp;#x200B;

This is a really important day.  The hedgies are going to be out for blood and this is what I would I would do if I was on the other side of this trade.

We know from yesterday that the brokerage accounts all feed our information to the hedge funds.  They know where our autocalling positions are, how much we are driving the price up with our buys now that we can and have placed long positions before the market open.

&amp;#x200B;

We also know that they were able to buy at the bottom of the market yesterday and some of us even had positions close at this point without our consent.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, we know that Steve Cohen was forced to shut down SAC Capital due to insider trading allegations in 2014 and they have given the hedge funds $2 billion which they would’ve used to take a long position at the market bottom yesterday to help cover their short position.  They have insider information on all of our positions.  They know the battle ground and will be planning accordingly.

&amp;#x200B;

If I was a hedgie, I would also drive the market up when it opens, taking profit as I go.  I would then get to a point where we have set off a lot of auto calls and I would sell out of my long position.  This would drive the market down and I would then sell out of my short position.  

&amp;#x200B;

Since we have been given the ability to jump back in, we're all charging into the market now that we can buy again. As we know from what we've found out today, Robinhood along with the other brokerage accounts give the hedge funds information on our positions, autocalls, and all investments we make. I think what might happen is we're gonna drive the market up when it opens, and as the hedge funds know this they will buy long positions and also drive the price up. The point of this is to hit our autocall positions so that we sell out. Just as we hit our autocalls, the hedge funds will sell their long positions and create a massive sell off between our autocalls and their sell offs. This will drive the price down to a point where they can sell their short positions which are calling today. We therefore need to remove our autocalls so as to continue to drive the price up. Continue to sustainably buy throughout the day so that they can't take advantage of any dips to close their short calls. They fucked us yesterday and created a dip so they could buy long positions. They bought this dip and drove the price up to 230. They have a lot of firepower to be able to do this from Point72 and Citadel.

&amp;#x200B;

Tldr: Remove your autocalls and continue to buy sustainably throughout the day and we'll all be eating meat in Valhalla by evening.

When I was young, the IMF crisis broke out in Korea in 1997. There were many reasons, but I think the main reason is the moral hazard of financial institutions.

So many people lost their jobs and committed suicide. My father also lost his job, and my mother cried a lot. My parents said sorry a lot when they saw me complaining about poor meal. The people who should be really sorry are not my parents, but the institutions that didnt do risk management at all.

The institutions had received lots of support from the government, but what did people who lost their jobs and homes get? People who did not receive any support took many risks from institutions. And the institutions survived from the crisis made it difficult for many people again by short attack.

A similar thing happened in States in 2008. You guys probably went through what I went through in 1997.

To be honest, at first, I thought it was a gamble. I mean GME and other things like AMC, etc. But since I saw yesterday's incident, I think it's a matter of justice and trust. So, i bought additional shares. i seriously hope you guys smashed the hedge funds and win.

Well the god damm broker doesn't let you do it, only 10% above the share price.

I called customer service and they told me that their risk department establishes that according to their policy. I obviously told them to go fuck themselves as they are limiting my ability to take advantage of volatility and that I'll be leaving asap.

I've investigated why they do that and it seems like they can't lend the shares to others if there's sales orders on them, so they fucked their clients so they can get the interest money.

Now I'll probably lose the squeeze time and maybe I'll sell too late and keep the shares as memorablia, because I'm not selling them before the squeeze 💎👐",Warning to DeGiro Europoors: the broker does not let you place sales orders over 10% of the current shareprice

l7tqz0,StockRecon,2021-01-29 14:24:57,GME,"  Good Morning Traders!

GME will open trading up around **$383 per share this morning!**

We have repeatedly HELD THE LINE and The Hedge Funds’ counter attacks have failed.

If you have Long CALL options on GME that are expiring today on January 29, 2021, here’s what you may consider doing with them:

**1.** **Buy the Stock at your strike price**. In my humble opinion (IMHO), this is the best option for our side of this War because it takes those shares off the market and out of the available float the Hedge Funds can buy back. 

You may have to call your brokerage firm and tell them you want to “**EXERCISE**” your options and buy the stock at your strike price. If the phone lines are jammed, you have up until about 1 hour after the market closes to call your brokerage and exercise your options. Technically you have up to 90 minutes after the market closes, but most brokers want to know in less than 1 hour after close so they have time to get your buy order filled.

&amp;#x200B;

**2.** **Roll your Option Up and Out.** If you do not have the cash to buy the shares outright as in choiuce number 1 above, then your next best choice IMHO is to roll up your strike price a little bit to a higher strike while simultaneously rolling out your expiration date to another Friday in the future. 

You can do this by clicking on your option and hit the “**ROLL**” button. Your order ticket will auto fill with drop down windows for you to change your strike price and date of expiration. Play around with it until you set a new little bit higher strike price and a new expiration date that pays you a “CREDIT” so that they pay you to Roll Up and Out and don’t have to pay any cash to make this move.

Technically what you are doing is “Selling to Close” the Call option you already own and simultaneously “Buying to Open” the next leg of your trade for a new Long CALL. This is a two-legged trade with two separate components to it on the same order ticket.

This is a good choice for our **Mother of all Wars** because when this ROLL trade is filled, you will still own a Long CALL which will tie up 100 shares of stock for every 1 option contract that the Hedge Funds cannot buy.

&amp;#x200B;

**3.** Third option to consider is to **Sell to Close your Long CALL** that you own and take the cash.  When you click on the order ticket to “Sell to Close”, the order ticket will populate with the highest BID price.  I always replace that price with a new price that’s a little more than half way between the Bid and the Ask prices to middle the market.

This is the worst choice for our War because it releases the 100 shares of GME stock that the Market Maker purchased to offset your Long CALL in order to trade Delta neutral. The Hedge Funds may then buy those 100 shares that are sold back into the market by the Market Maker when your Sell to Close order is filled. But you gotta’ do, what you gotta’ do.

Remember that every 1 contract represents 100 underlying shares. So multiple your prices that are quoted per share times 100 shares on any of the above three choices.

&amp;#x200B;

**Word of caution**. If you own a pair spread trade that expires today with both a long CALL and a Short Call remember to close your short leg today.   You  must close them today or the Market Makers can assign the stock to you and force you to buy it at the strike price that you set for your short CALL leg of the trade.

&amp;#x200B;

**Battle Strategy for today.**

For me, I plan on exercising my Long CALLS that expire today and buy the 100 shares of stock to remove them from the available Float.

Then I’m going to place “Buy LIMIT” orders to buy more and more shares.

Then I’m going to **HOLD THE LINE** until after the Short Squeeze is completed that will occur sometime during the next few weeks or possibly months.

The greedy bastard Hedge Funds are bleeding cash right now paying high interest rates on the billions of dollars they borrowed on the stock that they then sold short. If we’re patient and keep buying more shares and pushing the price up higher and higher we will eventually trigger a Margin Call on the Hedge Funds which will force them to close their position.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Hedge Funds need to buy approximately 59 million to cover their short** as near as I can figure now with the data available on Yahoo! Finance and FinViz.com and other financial websites.

And if we keep buying and holding the line, then there are not that many available shares for the Hedge Funds to buy which will force the Mother of all Short Squeezes to Vahalla!

&amp;#x200B;

**The Hedge Funds are Trapped.**

**KEEP BUYING and HOLD THE LINE!**

Blessings to you all,

I'm glad this place has quieted down enough for some actual DD written by a monkey with a keyboard and Adderall. Disclaimer: I am that monkey. Let me explain to you what happened, play by play. I will give you illiterates who hate reading a spoiler up front: **We were within approximately 30 seconds of triggering a nuclear bomb that would have blown up the market.** Do I have your attention? Here goes:

1. Yesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570. Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again? Really? We've been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock. This creates upwards pressure on the market. We've been seeing these movements all week.
2. Yesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and spook retail investors into a mass sell-off. It didn't work.
3. Last night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options. You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so. Very interesting and the first sign of pants-shitting fear.
4. Today, the market opened very strong. It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570.
5. At approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move.
6. Two minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling.
7. The trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.

Okay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this: **The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it.** What does that mean? It means they ran out of shares and/or capital. They wouldn't let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market. I saw an unsubstantiated post from a user who said **a small sell limit order executed at $2600 for him.** Do you get the severity of the situation, if that's true? It means the buying was getting to the point where it was just about to put INFINITE pressure on the price of the shares. It means virtually any ask was getting bid.

How do you get infinite upwards pressure? A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted. The call writers need shares to hedge. Retail is still buying more. The short sellers need over 100% of the float back. Add these together. There were more shares needed than existed on the open market. That's what a liquidity crisis is.

Listen to [this remarkable (if infuriating) interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RH4XKP55fM)

where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn't have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home. **DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO ""PROTECT THE MARKET""?** Hello! He's not talking about the market for GME shares. He's talking about the entire market! The New York Stock Exchange. The NASDAQ. All that.

Remember the movie *Snowpiercer*? Do you remember that scene where the lower class people realize the soldiers who oppress them have no bullets? Go to the 1:00 minute mark of this link: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o)

It kick starts a full blown rebellion. They have no bullets. It's the exact same in this market: No capital. No shares. Infinite losses inbound.

**TL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, ""Do I get my tendies now?"" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares. Do you get that? HOLD. Like the guy in the movie, scream, ""They're out of bullets!"" and create a stampede. That's how we win.**

They needed your shares so badly that they literally risked PRISON TIME to get them. They tried robbing you, and I'm not even exaggerating. They were within 30 seconds of all being wiped out today.",PLEASE UNDERSTAND why Robinhood pulled the stunt they did today. The big money shorts are out of shares and out of capital. We were on the cusp of triggering a full-blown infinite squeeze. The nuclear bomb of squeezes.

* it means that people who didn't believe in the squeeze in the first round can buy GME at a relatively low price for the second wave

* it means that all of the 💎👌 people can buy even more at this lower price

* it means that if we don't give in to the pressure, the motherfuckers will soon run out of funds!!!

* Red means hold and add more funds, to make room for movement!

* You don't panic sell! Panic selling is what they want you to do and panic selling is ALWAYS LOSS!!! It's never a well thought out action of logic, it's an action of fear!

This situation is only possible by your greed and malicious manipulation of the market. Trying to consolidate even more wealth with the people who don't need it.

I truly believe that you think we are like you so you are scared. We arent like you we don't want all the money. We don't want to rule the world. We want to have enough to eat and live. We want to experience life while learning skills that match who we are as people. That doesn't take billions or even millions per family.

However, we are tired of your shit. We are going to take everything we can right now because you have made BILLIONS over the pandemic. BILLIONS that was supposed to help the middle and lower class. You took it and hid and left us to rot all the while saying ""we all in this together.""

I do owe you a thank you though. Watching Billionaires cry on an interview has been like every Christmas present ever delivered by a pack of puppies. IT IS PURE JOY.

**Message 2 -** u/DEEPFUCKINGVALUE **and** r/wallstreetbets  
YOU ARE HEROES. This not an exaggeration. I mean this from the bottom of my soul. I have been more hopeful and excited this week than I ever have been before. You have done something that can restructure that shape of American (and World) finance. That will lead to changes in politics and government. This is something spectacular and I am proud to be a part. You found a way to use the game against them. We may not get the dragon in the heart but its spleen is not doing too well. This has the potential to change the status quo of the world. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

**Message 3 - THE GAMESTOP ARMY**  
YOU ARE AT WAR. Once again this is not an exaggeration. YOU ARE AT WAR. WE ARE AT WAR.  One more time for the back, WE ARE AT WAR. This is the Millenials battlefield. This is where you reclaim what was sold away by your grandparents. This is where you make the change you want to see in the world. We have been in a chaotic time leading to this. Politics is the circus. Whether you are left or right. Liberal or conservative. THIS IS THE REAL FIGHT.I am older now. I have lived in my car. I have entered abandoned homes to have a place to stay warm. I have served this country in the military. I never had much but have lived carefully. I have done alright, by the numbers I am now in the top %15 percent of American but I don't even break 6 figures. I live scared. I live like I'm one bad day away from losing everything because I have almost nothing compared to the true powers of the world. None of us are safe in these times. I have friends that say I have a form of Financial PTSD. I'm old enough that the system just has to hold a little longer and I can get out. If you are under 30 you should be very concerned about this. This is a chance to change the world for the better. THIS IS A CHANCE TO HELP THE LITTLE GUY GET SOME BACK. I have never invested in stocks until this year. I have invested as much as I can in GME (about 10K).  
I WILL HOLD IT UNTIL THE FUCKING SUN BURNS OUT IF I HAVE TO.  
I DONT CARE IF I WIN. I WANT THEM TO LOSE.  
THEY HAVE TAKEN SO MUCH FROM US AND THIS IS A CHANCE TO SHOW THAT YOU MATTER.  
YOU WANT SOCIAL JUSTICE. DO IT WITH THIS MONEY.  
YOU WANT HUMANITY TO TREAT THE EARTH BETTER DO IT WITH THIS MONEY.  
THIS MONEY IS RIGHTFULLY YOURS. TAKE AS MUCH AS YOU CAN.

Remember winning this fight lessens your enemy and gives you more resources. Carry the fight forward. This is a new type of warfare. They don't have a defense yet. Stay your ground. I am in this to make sure they lose. I truly hope you win though.

I AM HOLDING AND I WILL HOLD.

Please do this. Please restore some faith in humanity to this cynical old soul. I don't care if this goes anywhere. I wanted to raise my hand in this fight. This has been a glorious week.

Just in case... This is not financial advice. I just like the stock.","A message for Hedgie, /DFV, and the Gamestop army."

JPMorgan tells staff to stick to long-term investing Stephen Morris in London  As chaotic US stock trading resumed on Friday, 

JPMorgan sent an email to its investment banking staff about its personal account dealing (PAD) policy, reminding them that they are ""obligated to adhere to its requirements and restrictions, even during the recent market volatility"".  

The memo says that PAD is ""geared towards long-term, non-speculative investing and the expectation is that you bear this in mind when engaging in personal investing activities"".  Staff should also ""refrain from actual or perceived conflicts of interest that could arise due to their investment choices"" and be aware they are subject to minimum holding periods, so may not be able to ""immediately sell or buy"" during big stock swings.  

Furthermore, employees must ""hold themselves to the highest standards of ethical conduct"" and exercise ""good judgement in the absence of a specific policy or procedure"".

l7xpo8,StockRecon,2021-01-29 17:01:12,GME,"Yeah!  

 **Once again our Shield Wall is up and we're Holding the Line!**

The Hedge Funds have been probing our Wall since the open this morning trying to find weakness.

**But their efforts continue to fail!**

Together we are unstoppable!

&amp;#x200B;

They're trying new tricks today bombarding the news with dire warnings of pending disaster for we ""ignorant"" **Working Class Heroes** who they say don't know what we're doing.

That's all Bull Manure.

**We know exactly what we're doing.**

We continue to buy more shares every day to Dollar Cost Average into our cost basis and we're holding the line.

&amp;#x200B;

Hedge Funds are selling shares back and forth between themselves hoping to create a false narrative that the stock is selling off.   But **we know better!**

The Broker Dealer Citadel Securities announced today that they will no longer post the short interest data in order to deprive us of this valuable information and blind us.   Going forward only insider Billionaire Hedge Funds will have the short interest data to tilt the advantage to themselves.

**But that won't stop us either.**

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday as you know, Robin Hood and I believe maybe Interactive Brokers halted buying GME shares supposedly because they needed to raise money to cover their trades.  But many informed traders doubt that was the real reason they conveniently halted trading in the middle of the Hedge Fund counter attack which significantly benefited the Hedge Funds and screwed us.

**That didn't work either.**

&amp;#x200B;

My personal plan is to continue to buy more and more shares and **Hold the Line** until after the inevitable **Mother of all Short Squeezes** fires off and completes itself.  Days to Cover looks like it's around 2.5 to 5 days, but we're using stale data so it's just a guess.

**The Mother of ALL Short Squeezes has not even fired off yet, and maybe won't fire off for several weeks.**

**No matter.**  **We will wait for it.** 

&amp;#x200B;

**The Hedge Funds are Trapped and will have to cover their short positions eventually sooner or later which will spike the stock price to the Moon whenever it does happen!**

&amp;#x200B;

**WE HAVE AN INDOMITABLE SPIRIT, and a SIEGE MENTALITY.**

We will **Hold the Line** until the Squeeze fires off and then completely finishes over the course of 2 to 5 days to cover.   

&amp;#x200B;

We know that **the last hour on the last trading day of the Squeeze is when we'll really see the huge and I mean monstrously huge, off the charts, Major Spike higher in the Squeeze.**   

**It all happens in the last hour of trading when the Hedge Funds are forced to cover their short positions at any price.  They are trapped and there is no way out.**  

**During the last hour of the Squeeze, they are forced to get out at any price.  At any price.**

&amp;#x200B;

**You'll know it, when the price spikes unbelievably, incredibly, monstrously high right off of the charts in the last hour of trading.**  

By that time **the monstrous spike in price will launch us to Mars** which we'll terraform and colonize with Elon and become a multi-planetary species.  

&amp;#x200B;

At that time and only at that time, I may consider letting them buy a tiny, tiny portion of my shares for  $20,000 per share.  But only a small portion so I can let the rest ride.

Meanwhile we're going to patiently wait and wait and wait and **Hold the Line** until the Squeeze completely finishes before we begin to scale out of some of our positions and take some chips off of the table in the last hour of trading and then **let the rest ride**.

&amp;#x200B;

Blessing to you All!

**TLDR**; The DTC raised collateral limits to settle certain stock transactions from 1-3% to 100% for the 2 days held in escrow, which trickled down to clearing houses which don’t have the capital to clear the current trading volume at 100% collateral, so clearing houses restricted buying of those stocks to prevent themselves going under. Clearing houses are securing loans to bridge the gap and once additional capital is secured, will re-admit buying of those restricted stocks, including our beloved $GME.

🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀

What is the DTC?

The Depository Trust Company is the bee’s knees. Back in the day when you bought a stock, you were given a piece of paper, like a $10 bill in your wallet, to certify that you have cleared payment of the stock and are now the rightful owner. This was all fine and dandy in the olden days when there far were fewer traders and even fewer companies to trade, but pesky humans just love to continue to invent new things, especially computers.

Can you imagine trying to trade stocks today still backed by pieces of paper? It just isn’t feasible. So in the early 1970s a digital solution was devised; enter the DTC.

The DTC is the record keeper of who owns what, and they certify &gt;95% of all trades on the market. They are the ones who certify that /u/DeepFuckingValue (aka the God of WSB) actually owns the 50,000 shares he paid for a year ago and ensured whomever sold him those 50,000 shares got paid for them.

Watch the video: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dtc.asp

DTC guarantees that if you sell a share, you will be paid for selling that share. Very important fundamental service provided.

🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀

The two sides of the trade.

Whenever a trade happens there are two sides; the customer side and the street side (yes, the Wall Street). Brokers (Robinhood, e-trade, etc.) represent the customer side of the trade and the market makers represent the street side. When you place an order to buy a share from your broker, they in turn go to their Market Maker(s) to make the trade. The MM, after verifying things appears kosher, then sends the order to their clearing firm to begin settling the trade. In order to settle the trade with the DTC, the clearing firm is required to pay the DTC somewhere between 1%-3% of the notional value of the trade to be held as collateral in escrow for \~2 business days until the trade is settled. The clearing firm submits the trade to the DTC who certifies the trade and facilitates the final transaction and release of funds.

1. /u/DeepFuckingValue buys 50,000 shares @ $5/share ($250,000)
2. Robinhood places order with their MM, Citadel (they bailed out Melvin with $2,750,000,000) who then communicates this order with the stock exchange the security is listed on
3. Citadel sends order to Apex (clearing house for Robinhood, Webull, Tastyworks, SoFi, Ally, and most of the newer app-based trading startups)
4. Apex sends trade to the DTC along with 2% collateral ($50,000)
5. Two days later the DTC says the trade is good and settles the transaction
6. The seller is paid $250,000 and /u/DeepFuckingValue is given his 50,000 shares. Brokers basically front the cash to make it all official during the 2 day settling period and your transaction shows in your account already even though it technically hasn’t yet settled.

🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀

So what happened on Thursday when buying became restricted?

https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Es2YXQNVEAAepgT.png

The DTC, and consequently some clearing houses, for certain stocks raised their collateral requirements from \~2% to 100%. You read that right. If the collateral to buy 50,000 shares @ $5/share ($250k) was 2% ($50k), it was now raised to $250k. That means for every single buy order (from Robinhood, Webull, etc.) running through their clearing house was required to front 100% of the notional value to their clearing house, Apex, and have it sit there in escrow for 2 business days. 

Well look at the trade volume on $GME, it was averaging \~70M/day this past week before Apex’s buying restriction. If we assume half that daily volume was buy orders, 35,000,000 trades \* x shares per trade \* $$$/share = billions. Clearing houses simply are not equipped to front these levels of cash at 100% collateral, so buying was forcibly restricted.

It’s important to note that there is no collateral required on the other side of the deal, to sell a share, collateral is only required on the buy side. This is why you could still sell your share but not buy additional shares.

Another note about the clearing firms is, once trades that happened two days ago settle, the funds used for collateral become available to them again and if their risk models allow it, can re-open accepting new buy orders.

Brokers using different clearing houses, or brokers that can self-clear their trades, were generally still capable of handling these new requirements. A presumption could be made that if they are already large enough to be able to self-clear trades then they probably have access to more capital to meet collateral requirements and aren’t forced to deny new buy orders.

**I highly encourage each and every one of you to watch this interview with Webull’s CEO who explains exactly how they and brokers using Apex as their clearing house were forced to restrict buy orders due to increased collateral requirements: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RS4JIEVyXM**

🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀

Now let’s look at this from the other side of the trade.

Melvin Capital shorted millions of shares of $GME. Their broker facilitated this action, which in-turn was transacted by their market maker(s), ran through their clearing house(s) and settled by the DTC. What happens when Melvin is bled dry?

Melvin loses everything, and it’s still not enough to cover their debt. The clearing house is next on the chopping block and steps in to provide the funds that Melvin can no longer provide. They write it off as a loss and will be amongst the first in line of creditors seeking payment during Melvin’s solvency process to try and recoup whatever possible. But what happens if they can’t cover the cost of all of those shares?

And that’s where we’re at today. Clearing houses are seeking short-term bridge loans from major institutional banks to secure enough $$$ to settle everybody’s trades. They are teetering on the edge and are shoring up their accounts for the pending tidal wave that is our beloved short squeeze. If they run out of money, the market could cease to function properly and we’re looking at a near system-wide collapse.

Bleeding Melvin dry means bleeding Melvin, their market maker(s), AND their clearing house(s). The MMs &amp; the clearing house(s) are collateral damage and should not be the target of our focus. But don’t worry, they’re all insured anyways, but they still need funds now to continue to function nominally.

So at the end of the day, Citadel didn’t exactly go to each broker and tell them “hey, stop letting people buy shares so we can exit out of our positions.” But they are using their MM advantage to continue their ladder attacks to drive the price down. As a MM they are allowed to increase liquidity by creating new shorted shares, but they must be repaid by market close. 

So are they playing dirty? Of course they are, and we expected them to. If you managed billions of dollars, wouldn’t you do everything in your power to prevent losing it? Sure, they didn’t heed warnings from their risk assessment department who probably told them to turn tail and cut their losses, doubled-down, and committed to giving us all our long-awaited tendies.

🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀

Keep up the good fight, 💎👐, **the squeeze has not squoze**

Guys,

I'm retarded and wanted to post to WallStreetBets but couldn't could someone do this for me? I wanted to share a few thoughts. This is an unprecedented opportunity to be the catalyst for change. I believe there are more shares held than are current in existence which will probably have to be resolved after the gamma squeeze happens, but before the short squeeze does. This is probably an opportunity for GME to do a second offering with the Hedges and Brokerages footing the bill. When the short squeeze happens though... What do you think about not just taking our money and running?

What do you think about a negotiated settlement spread across the board that will most likely result in a much large payout for all of us (10K-ish? Help?), but give us an opportunity to have a seat at the table when regulation is revised to prevent future situations like this. We don't really have a free market we have an oligarchy, crony capitalism, politicians that are bought and paid for and playing field is titled heavily in the god-emperors class's favor and exempt from real world consequences. What do you guys think about some of these points?

1. Large negotiated payout, possibly to the point that they require a government bailout. Remember, we never got ours in 2008, with interest maybe this will even the score. So the bailout goes to Old Guard but actually ends up in our pocket, ideally preventing a second bailout that would put them right back in the position of power. Teachers, Firefighters, Garbage Collector's, Students, Gamers, Home makers.... Normal people who will actually spend the money on cars, houses, charity, family, ect. The wealth will ACTUALLY be distributed throughout the economy, with it's starting point being us, the holders since we footed all the risk... Lets call this trickle up economics. We're not going to lock up half of the nations wealth in an account comprised of T-Bills, we'll spend it. Currently, power (wealth) is concentrated in the 1 %, if we actually get our due this could really be a free market AND a redistribution of wealth.
2. We're all going to be tax at the highest bracket, so this benefits the government and should in return, benefit the people (ideally).
3. Even the playing field, lets eliminate the Accredited Investor designation. It's bullshit the rich get access to the best paying investments.
4. Limit shorting (obviously) max 50-75% so that its not a tool to push markets but to speculate and create liquidity. Maybe individual tracking for each security so this doesn't happen again (think some utility crypto currency), and potentially a holding period required for said tracked security prior to shorting.
5. Transparency, published positions with holding and trading details to include short positions for entities (not, personal) participating in the securities market. We are an open forum, and have been able to make informed decisions, not in spite of, but because of the variety of opinions and research we have access to.

Anyone else think this is our chance to not just change things for ourselves, but everyone else?",Fiscal Revolution

Force them to buy at OUR price. This shit should be pinned and reposted everywhere. This is not financial advice I failed math and pee in my bed.

l7z2on,C4ntStopg4m3stop,2021-01-29 17:52:22,GME," I have seen posts about short-sellers; why do they need to close their position? Can't they hold out until the price goes down? They can indeed do that, but they have to pay to borrow those shares, and I got curious, what ARE they paying to not close?

So I looked it up and thought I would share. I found this short FAQ on selling short shares providing rough calculations based on the current price of GME,

[https://ibkr.info/article/1146](https://ibkr.info/article/1146)

I found a rate of 32\~% on GME short Borrow Fee Rate, and I am lazy and assuming 60 million shares of being shorted every day.

60,000,000 shares X $300/share = $18 billion dollars are being borrowed for shorting.

$18 Billion \* 32% / 360 days in year = $16 million dollars a day (trading day or not)

Roughly, they are losing $300 million a month! Also, the money that they have tied to margin on the short cannot be used elsewhere. If they could have been making 5% somewhere else, they are effectively paying 37% to short GME stock.

So you say, ""when will the squeeze happen?"" The better question is WHY the squeeze will happen. At some point, these hedge funds are going to need that money for something else. They are losing 300 million a month. That is assuming the price does not go up. If it goes up any more, they are losing more on interest (the amount they pay in interest is calculated daily).

The other problem for them is what happens when they cannot borrow shares anymore. If I decide, I want to sell, and the brokerage has to get the stock back from the short-seller. The short-seller has to go to the market and buy for whatever price is available.

In a way, as a stock owner, YOU CAN SET YOUR OWN PRICE. If the liquidity in the market disappears, you can set your price to be $1000, AND THEY HAVE TO PAY IT TO GIVE YOUR STOCK BACK.

Holding the stock, you are squeezing hedge funds and market makers for as long as there is no liquidity for GME stock.",Why the Short Squeeze cannot go on forever!

Probably last night and all morning the WS dicks have been meeting with Yellen and her little task force to broker a deal, because they don’t want the little guy to get hurt (BS i know) and they can’t have a catastrophic financial event right now (think of GME like the bottom block in a game of jenga) and here’s what I think the deal might look like:
1. They will freeze trading on GME and maybe a couple of the other stocks.
2. The short trades will be scratched and the short trade assholes will pay some fixed $ amount per share to the SEC that hurts but not too much
3. The SEC will pay shareholders the market price at the moment trading halted AND allow them to keep their shares 
4. Trading will resume the following business day but shorts are no longer in play
5. New rules will be in effect for short trading - probably they will need to make short info more transparent and accessible to all traders

Why This Weekend Is So Crucial...

Ok listen up retards... I know it's Friday and some of you short-term monkey brains are thinking about bailing on your brothers. Your paper hands are beginning to cramp up. I get it. **BUT WE CANNOT SELL!**  


There are still **MASSIVE** amounts of shorts on $GME. Still well over 113% of total shares floated (*from S3 Partners*). Some old shorts have gotten out, but many **NEW** shorts have taken their place in the past couple of days hoping that $GME will die out.  


# Here is the key part...

They are literally PRAYING for us to sell our shares and end this entire thing today. They are HOPING that they can make back their money at our expense... **BECAUSE EVERY SINGLE DAY THAT THEY HOLD THEIR SHORT POSITIONS IS COSTING THEM BILLIONS OF DOLLARS COLLECTIVELY!!!**  


# BILLIONS A DAY.

All we need to do is **HOLD**. That's it. We will cost them so much money today, next Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and on and on. Soon enough they won't be able to pay the cost of their shorts or it just won't be worth the cost anymore and they will all eventually have to bail. **THAT IS GOING TO BE THE SQUEEZE**. Once the costs keep adding up, they will start to bail and the rest will follow.  


WE MUST STAY STRONG. DON’T FORGET WHAT THEY HAVE DONE TO US. IT'S A GAME OF CHICKEN. WHOEVER BLINKS FIRST.. LOSES.  
We're not fucking blinking.  


**TL/DR: HOLD. HOLD. HOLD. THIS WEEKEND INTO NEXT WEEK IS CRUCIAL!**

UPVOTE AND SHARE

In the last hour of trading some of us are predicting they will launch a short ladder attack to make it look like it’s selling off to trick you into selling your shares. Their goal is to go under $115 to get out of their expiring contracts. This will be a major victory for them.

Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn’t. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off). Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors.

UPVOTE AND SHARE

In the last hour of trading some of us are predicting they will launch a short ladder attack to make it look like it’s selling off to trick you into selling your shares. Their goal is to go under $115 to get out of their expiring contracts. This will be a major victory for them.

Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn’t. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off). Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it’s unlikely that it’s anyone at all.

ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS HOLD HOLD HOLD! DONT GET PAPER HANDS DURING THE LAST HOUR, ITS WHAT THEY WANT!

l81tt1,QuoraWordLimit,2021-01-29 19:35:38,GME,"I’m new to reddit sorry if this violates anything...

My greedy ass was riding the GME train to gain profit when the squeeze happened; I was going to go against what everyone was saying and pull out after getting ‘X’ amount of returns this week instead of holding on Friday. But after reading all the posts on WSB and after realising this is less a money hungry fueled stock rise and more a personal fuck you to the rich I’ve decided to HOLD my positions until GME crashes to $0. I have no personal experiences of the GFC but the struggles, commitment and passion on this page is so strong that it has convinced me, and no doubt others, to change their perspective of our positions on GME. 

Can someone make a poll or something to show how many people are actually lifetime holders of GME as opposed to pump and dumpers? If there were more lifetime holders surely it would convince more people to hold as well and make the current GME price a new standard? I think people like me would’ve eventually sold because we thought that’s what everyone else would do after the spike but if we all commit and promise each other to HOLD OUR DIAMOND HANDS we can use GME as a safe-haven exactly how people use Gold or Bitcoin as a safe haven. A public poll would definitely convince more of us to hold forever and once the hedge funds realise no one is backing they will really start to close their GME positions because we all know they haven’t yet. 

I’m not a financer (this is not financial advice) and have very little knowledge on this; like countless others, I’m just a regular guy who came for the profits but stayed for the war. 

But to summarise, could GME become a financial safe haven at all!? If so, can someone make a bot-proof poll to show that we are all committed to holding GME for a lifetime and not just until the squeeze is over?!",GME Long Term Prospects

l81uxo,StockRecon,2021-01-29 19:36:49,GME,"**Today's small volume and price action trading within a tight daily range does not suggest that today is the beginning of the Mother of all Short Squeezes.**

The greedy bastards are just messing with us selling shares back and forth between themselves hoping to shake us out before they can begin to cover their shorts in earnest.   And that **may take weeks for it to happen.**

&amp;#x200B;

Remember that Hedge Fund Melvin got a **2.75 Billion Dollar cash infusion loan** from their Hedge Fund buddies and investors earlier this week.   That large chunk of cash gives them plenty of room to try to wait us out hoping that eventually we will get bored and ignorantly tap out. 

**But** **that ain't gonna' happen!**

&amp;#x200B;

**This is now a waiting game.**

But the good news is that we control the massive chunk of the stock that the Hedge Funds desperately need to buy from us in order to exit this nightmare of a trade-gone-wrong for them.

**We have a SIEGE MENTALITY which will crush them in the end.**

**And there's nothing they can do about it.**

&amp;#x200B;

**The Hedge Funds are Trapped** so they will hold on as long as possible hoping we will give up and sell them our shares before the squeeze even begins so they can exit with a small loss instead of losing everything they own and going bankrupt.

But **we're too smart for that!**

&amp;#x200B;

**We're going to keep on buying more and more shares to increase our control of this trade.**

And we're going to HOLD THE LINE at all costs until the price shoots up to the moon and beyond.

And **there's nothing they can do about it.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Keep Buying and HOLD THE LINE!**

**It costs us almost nothing to hold our shares of stock and wait them out.**

But meanwhile **the Hedge Funds are hemorrhaging cash big time on the interest they have to pay on their massive multi-billion dollar loan** (aka, shares) that they originally borrowed from their Broker Dealers to then sell short.  

&amp;#x200B;

Just imagine how much loan interest you would have to pay every day on a multi-billion dollar student loan? 

That's what happening right now to the Hedge Funds, only on steroids.

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually they will run out of cash to make their daily interest payments, and their Broker Dealers will demand a **Margin Call** which will force them to buy shares to cover at any asking price we determine.

**In the end, they're going to have to pay the price per share that we set.**  

&amp;#x200B;

**We're in control of this trade** and that's why they're freaking out on every TV station, in every newspaper around the world, magazines, and in their blogs, trolling the internet with their BOTS spreading disinformation, and on YouTube, and why Facebook and Robin Hood shut us down, and why some of us are getting throttled back and slowed down, et al. 

&amp;#x200B;

We'll know the Squeeze when it begins by a massive sudden spike in price accompanied by a huge spike in volume of shares traded as the limited number of available shares drives the price higher and higher due to **the Law of Supply and Demand**.  

Since we control THE major chunk of the Supply of shares, the demand will push prices up into outer space.

We have THE **Supply** which we will use to **Demand** that they pay our asking price or we won't sell to them.

&amp;#x200B;

Keep buying and HOLD THE LINE.

**Dig in for what may be a long siege**, or maybe not depending on whether the Hedge Funds can keep borrowing more cash from their buddies to stay alive.  

Eventually even their best buddies will cut them off and refuse to lend them any more new money which will then trigger the beginning of a 3 - 5 day squeeze.

The last hour of trading on the last day of that 3-5 day long Squeeze is when the fun begins.

**The lack of supply will drive the price up, up, and away creating life-changing, generational wealth for our families.**

&amp;#x200B;

This is EPIC!   

So have fun, dig in, and HOLD THE LINE!

&amp;#x200B;

This former Marine is dug into a cozy foxhole sitting on top of the high ground and is quite content to just wait them out.   Sooner or later they'll have to come out into the open and that's when the real fun will begin.  Meanwhile, I just wait and continue to stalk them.

&amp;#x200B;

Blessings to you all,

GME (GAMESTOP) WHY THIS WEEKEND IS IMPORTANT.... (Repost)

Why This Weekend Is So Crucial...

Ok listen up retards... I know it's Friday and some of you short-term monkey brains are thinking about bailing on your brothers. Your paper hands are beginning to cramp up. I get it. **BUT WE CANNOT SELL!**

There are still **MASSIVE** amounts of shorts on $GME. Still well over 113% of total shares floated (*from S3 Partners*). Some old shorts have gotten out, but many **NEW** shorts have taken their place in the past couple of days hoping that $GME will die out.

Here is the key part...

They are literally PRAYING for us to sell our shares and end this entire thing today. They are HOPING that they can make back their money at our expense... **BECAUSE EVERY SINGLE DAY THAT THEY HOLD THEIR SHORT POSITIONS IS COSTING THEM BILLIONS OF DOLLARS COLLECTIVELY!!!**

BILLIONS A DAY.

All we need to do is **HOLD**. That's it. We will cost them so much money today, next Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and on and on. Soon enough they won't be able to pay the cost of their shorts or it just won't be worth the cost anymore and they will all eventually have to bail. **THAT IS GOING TO BE THE SQUEEZE**. Once the costs keep adding up, they will start to bail and the rest will follow.

WE MUST STAY STRONG. DON’T FORGET WHAT THEY HAVE DONE TO US. IT'S A GAME OF CHICKEN. WHOEVER BLINKS FIRST.. LOSES.  
We're not fucking blinking.

**TL/DR: HOLD. HOLD. HOLD. THIS WEEKEND INTO NEXT WEEK IS CRUCIAL!**

l829m5,Several_Meet_8653,2021-01-29 19:52:16,GME,"The Squeeze most likely not trigger for weeks, but not today

**Today's small volume and price action trading within a tight daily range does not suggest that today is the beginning of the Mother of all Short Squeezes.**

The greedy bastards are just messing with us selling shares back and forth between themselves hoping to shake us out before they can begin to cover their shorts in earnest.   And that **may take weeks for it to happen.**

&amp;#x200B;

Remember that Hedge Fund Melvin got a **2.75 Billion Dollar cash infusion loan** from their Hedge Fund buddies and investors earlier this week.   That large chunk of cash gives them plenty of room to try to wait us out hoping that eventually we will get bored and ignorantly tap out. 

**But** **that ain't gonna' happen!**

&amp;#x200B;

**This is now a waiting game.**

But the good news is that we control the massive chunk of the stock that the Hedge Funds desperately need to buy from us in order to exit this nightmare of a trade-gone-wrong for them.

**We have a SIEGE MENTALITY which will crush them in the end.**

**And there's nothing they can do about it.**

&amp;#x200B;

**The Hedge Funds are Trapped** so they will hold on as long as possible hoping we will give up and sell them our shares before the squeeze even begins so they can exit with a small loss instead of losing everything they own and going bankrupt.

But **we're too smart for that!**

&amp;#x200B;

**We're going to keep on buying more and more shares to increase our control of this trade.**

And we're going to HOLD THE LINE at all costs until the price shoots up to the moon and beyond.

And **there's nothing they can do about it.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Keep Buying and HOLD THE LINE!**

**It costs us almost nothing to hold our shares of stock and wait them out.**

But meanwhile **the Hedge Funds are hemorrhaging cash big time on the interest they have to pay on their massive multi-billion dollar loan** (aka, shares) that they originally borrowed from their Broker Dealers to then sell short.  

&amp;#x200B;

Just imagine how much loan interest you would have to pay every day on a multi-billion dollar student loan? 

That's what happening right now to the Hedge Funds, only on steroids.

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually they will run out of cash to make their daily interest payments, and their Broker Dealers will demand a **Margin Call** which will force them to buy shares to cover at any asking price we determine.

**In the end, they're going to have to pay the price per share that we set.**  

&amp;#x200B;

**We're in control of this trade** and that's why they're freaking out on every TV station, in every newspaper around the world, magazines, and in their blogs, trolling the internet with their BOTS spreading disinformation, and on YouTube, and why Facebook and Robin Hood shut us down, and why some of us are getting throttled back and slowed down, et al. 

&amp;#x200B;

We'll know the Squeeze when it begins by a massive sudden spike in price accompanied by a huge spike in volume of shares traded as the limited number of available shares drives the price higher and higher due to **the Law of Supply and Demand**.  

Since we control THE major chunk of the Supply of shares, the demand will push prices up into outer space.

We have THE **Supply** which we will use to **Demand** that they pay our asking price or we won't sell to them.

&amp;#x200B;

Keep buying and HOLD THE LINE.

**Dig in for what may be a long siege**, or maybe not depending on whether the Hedge Funds can keep borrowing more cash from their buddies to stay alive.  

Eventually even their best buddies will cut them off and refuse to lend them any more new money which will then trigger the beginning of a 3 - 5 day squeeze.

The last hour of trading on the last day of that 3-5 day long Squeeze is when the fun begins.

**The lack of supply will drive the price up, up, and away creating life-changing, generational wealth for our families.**

This is EPIC!   

So have fun, dig in, and HOLD THE LINE!!! 
  

Full Disclosure: This is not investment advice. I am not an investment advisor. Do your own research and make your own decisions. Don't invest or bet more than you can afford to lose. I own a lot of shares of GME and also own Long CALLs on GME.

Why did RH restricted stocks to first only 5 and now 1? Because the line to buy GME is getting bigger and bigger for retail. 

They have to restrict trade coming from the little guy because Melvin &amp; CucKSachs desperately need as many stocks as possible to sell to their other Hedgy friends.

It appears to be a legit story from all that we've witnessed in the price and volume action this week.

&amp;#x200B;

It states the GME Short Sellers still have not covered their short positions and are holding on and delaying hoping for lower prices.

This week they only closed out 5 million shares on the dip on Thursday out of the 59 million shares still shorted.

This is now a waiting game so HOLD THE LINE and we'll wait them out!

&amp;#x200B;

**CNBC Article** 

  **GameStop short sellers are still not surrendering despite nearly $20 billion in losses this month**

&amp;#x200B;

* **Short-selling hedge funds have suffered a mark-to-market loss of $19.75 billion year to date in the brick-and-mortar video game retailer GameStop, according to data from S3 Partners.**

&amp;#x200B;

* **Still, short sellers mostly are holding onto their bearish positions or they are being replaced by new hedge funds willing to bet against the stock.**

&amp;#x200B;

* **GameStop shares that have been borrowed and sold short have declined by just about 5 million over the last week, marking an 8% dip in the short interest, according to S3.**

&amp;#x200B;

* **Most of the short covering occurred on Thursday, when the stock fell for the first time in six days.**

&amp;#x200B;

Dig in BOIS and HOLD THE Line!

How to Buy GME etc [Loophole]

Robinhood and other shitty brokerages are allowing us to buy 2, 5, or very low numbers of GME. However, they are allowing option contracts.

Here’s a trick that will work.

1) Go to Feb 5 option.
2) Scroll all the way down the call list
3) Buy GME call option with the cheapest +x.xx%
4) Immediately exercise.

I just exercised 2 contracts and now have 200 shares, blocking the shorts. You can repeat this process over and over if you are buying a lot.

Best of luck out there! Let’s get them!!!

l85hfo,StockRecon,2021-01-29 21:57:14,GME,"A [CNBC.com](https://CNBC.com) news article that posted today states this info (which may or may not be legit IMHO):

&amp;#x200B;

**Article**

The video game stock has been the star of the show on the **WallStreetBets** Reddit forum, **whose membership has grown rapidly to over 5 million**.  A wave of day traders continued to encourage each other to pile into GameStop’s shares and call options, creating a massive short squeeze that inflicted pain for hedge funds betting against the stock.

**The borrow fee on GameStop’s stock — or the cost-to-borrow shares for the purpose of selling them short — jumped to 29.32% on existing shorts** and 50% on new short positions, S3 said.

“If most of the shorts had covered, we would not be seeing stock borrow rates at these high levels — by now you would be able to borrow GME stock at single digit levels due to an increase in the lendable stock loan supply due to borrowed shares being returned after all the ‘supposed’ buy-to-covers,” Dusaniwsky said.

**GameStop remained the most-shorted name in the market as short interest as a percentage of shares available for trading stands at 113.31%,** S3 said.

End.

&amp;#x200B;

**So how long do you think Melvin Capital Hedge Fund and their friends can hold out when they're paying 29.32% interest rate on the value of the shares they borrowed to sell short?**

We merely need to keep buying more shares and Hold the Line and wait them out.

Eventually they will burn through their cash **paying 29.32% interest on their loans** and their Broker Dealer will make a Margin Call and force them to buy to cover at whatever price, any price they can buy shares to cover.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Hedge Funds are Trapped!**

**They still need to buy back $11.2 Billion worth of GME stock which represents 113% of the Float to exit their massively losing position.**  Even after battling all week long, they are still massively oversold!

Every day they delay buying back our shares to close out their short positions they are hemorrhaging train loads of money paying that **29.23% interest** **rate** on the value of the shares they borrowed.

**It is unsustainable.**  

At some point in the near future, they will be forced to close their positions and accept their beating.

&amp;#x200B;

WallStreetBets' community is now **5 million members strong** with more joining our fight every day.

Everyone new who joins us buys more and more shares which pushes up the price higher and higher.

&amp;#x200B;

**We just need to dig in and wait them out.**

&amp;#x200B;

We are now in a Siege and have them surrounded.  

The only way out for them is to buy our shares at an exorbitant price we decide.   

We're going to force them to transfer $11.2 billion over to **Working Class Heroes** in one of the greatest transfer of wealth in a century.

**Keep Buying to push the price higher and higher and Hold the Line!**

This is Epic.

Roaring Kitty frequents open insider - so he knew about this huge sale, and still held - making him even more of a legend.  

So many questions. What kind of guy shows such a huge lack of confidence as a new Director after only 8 months? Seems really screwed up to have the new guy sell off over 810,000 shares almost immediately. He's the Chief Investment Officer for Hestia Capital - some investment company. 

So confusing - can anyone explain how this guy get's on the board and starts gutting from the inside?  How does Mr. ""no faith"" infiltrate and gut from the inside?",New GME Director sold 17 million worth of GME a few weeks ago. It would be worth 265 Million today.

All this has become big, the world is watching us. 

I don't want to seem fearful, but a lot of people, have bet all their savings in this game to change the way the world is spinning and to fuck the shorts. To bend the hedgefucks over. To make history. And to make some cash, tbh. 

Some people already made a lot of money with this. And some are risking everything they have for this cause, by following now. We are holding together. We are standing together. Some are playing. Some are balls deep into this.

When all this will come to an end, we should make sure no one will be left behind, no matter what the outcome is. Back up those who might be in need. Otherwise we are no better than the bulls and bears. 

Some people here need hope to go through this. 

Some are getting depressed even thinking about losing. 

A good friend of mine is already joking about ending his life when this goes wrong. 


People will sell because they are scared. 
Remember to spread some hope. Remember to hold!

This thing is going to the moon and it will be months. DO NOT SELL IT. Also SEC noticed the disgusting thing Robinhood is doing blocking and limiting orders, they will get beaten up, eventually they can freeze accounts, so to avoid problems transfer your funds and holdings, I suggest webull, they're app is even way better and complete than RH and they also give you free stocks (I believe 2 or 4) when you transfer your stocks and holdings to them.  
You don't sell when things go down or you take the L, they know and we must know, you hold it to the moon, until suits won't have any more leverage to cover and banks will turn them down.  
Ultimately, this is not about making money, we all have our portfolios for that, this is a battle to level the playground, to obtain fair rules and regulations, to stop having those coke heads smashing up and killing companies and people, causing worlwide financial crisis without moral risk.

Basically once again: If we hold on monday and beyond, there will be a chain reaction of shorted stocks that need to be returned, but if none are to be had the price will go further up and once they start buying to cover some of the shorts (which i dont believe has happened yet, despite the CNBC lies) its gonna start the real squeeze.

I got a great career paying 90k a year. I got my whole life to make smart investments. I figure I’d be an idiot, an “Austist”, an “Ape”, a “Diamond hand”, a “smooth brain” or any number of words that I’ve seen as I have obcessively read the WSB posts after joining a few days ago. But I don’t think I am any of those things.

I once had a rule... once I double my money, do not double it... well... I haven’t doubled since buying in... but there damn sure isn’t a way out of this that I can see. 

Market manipulation. Endless equity. New traders buying up the shorts against GME. That’s what a smart person would do. That’s what I should do.

Now here I am...

20k and holding stock...

And for what...

I thought taking 20k loss was gonna be easy... like I said, I can make that back in a year.

But damn...

I just didn’t know how dark it would cloud my mind.

How much energy I would waste worrying about my bet...

I’m holding like I have Diamond hands. I’ve seen 50% of my bet dip... only to hold on by juice from the WSB echo chamber... but I don’t feel Diamond hands on the inside...

How many of you feel paper handed on the inside?

Maybe I’m the only one dumb enough to make a bet that I would want to chicken out on.

It takes a dumb person to make an extraordinary bet expecting to win...

Why did I expect to win this? I definitely am not in it for an economic revolution, primarily. I am definitely in It for the gains... I just hope, that with the right amount of drugs, I can eventually cloud my memory from this week that is already kind of foggy with the lack of sleep.

somehow, upon losing 20 grand next week once my shares plummet, I’ll convince myself that I was in it for the revolution. That this was a “charity bet”. So that those that were really poor, that barely got any help, that with nothing to lose bought GME below 100... those guys that have been poor all their lives are probably gone... replaced by the middling upper...

Enjoy your tendies, fellas. This was a very effective wealth transfer from the middling to the poor... I hope... 

But it probably wasn’t.

And the rich will get their revenge.

Why This Weekend Is So Crucial...

Ok listen up retards... I know it's Friday and some of you short-term monkey brains are thinking about bailing on your brothers. Your paper hands are beginning to cramp up. I get it. **BUT WE CANNOT SELL!**  


There are still **MASSIVE** amounts of shorts on $GME. Still well over 113% of total shares floated (*from S3 Partners*). Some old shorts have gotten out, but many **NEW** shorts have taken their place in the past couple of days hoping that $GME will die out.  


# Here is the key part...

They are literally PRAYING for us to sell our shares and end this entire thing today. They are HOPING that they can make back their money at our expense... **BECAUSE EVERY SINGLE DAY THAT THEY HOLD THEIR SHORT POSITIONS IS COSTING THEM BILLIONS OF DOLLARS COLLECTIVELY!!!**  


# BILLIONS A DAY.

All we need to do is **HOLD**. That's it. We will cost them so much money today, next Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and on and on. Soon enough they won't be able to pay the cost of their shorts or it just won't be worth the cost anymore and they will all eventually have to bail. **THAT IS GOING TO BE THE SQUEEZE**. Once the costs keep adding up, they will start to bail and the rest will follow.  


WE MUST STAY STRONG. DON’T FORGET WHAT THEY HAVE DONE TO US. IT'S A GAME OF CHICKEN. WHOEVER BLINKS FIRST.. LOSES.  
We're not fucking blinking.  


**TL/DR: HOLD. HOLD. HOLD. THIS WEEKEND INTO NEXT WEEK IS CRUCIAL!**

Now... I have almost fully written off this money as I am not exactly sure how this is going to pan out. so I have the following questions.

1) I learned that a company can borrow shares from someone and then use these shares to ""ladder"" etc. Are they able to do this indefinitely? If we are looking for billions of dollars in a pay-out are they not better off just paying the interest until some/most of us cave?

2) How can they owe more shares than are in the pot? I keep reading 127-148% How is that possible? Through borrowing shares? \^ can they do this infinitely? 

3) I'll assume the guys that jumped in at $4-40 are going to walk out relatively okay no matter when/if the ""squeeze"" happens. How will this process work and will most of us end up walking out empty handed? When the squeeze happens there will not be any buyers left and you'll have some shares sitting at a ridiculous price.

4) It seems like a large percentage of the shares are being held by large corporations. What is stopping these companies from just covering each others asses? How long can this go on before the average joe cracks and sells? 

It's really scrambled but if you can answer any of these/give insight that would be great. Anyways, diamond handing this shit!!!!",What's our end-game?

l8cp8q,Anwbrw19,2021-01-30 03:30:24,GME,"OK, listen up, you late-to-the-party, crayon-eating homunculus, here's what's going on:

Over the past year, hedge fund supervillains have made money by selling shares of Gamestop they don't actually own - they've just borrowed them. Short selling. If they sell enough they can drive the price down so far that when they eventually need to return the shares they borrowed, they can get them cheap. It's free money. They throw a couple hundred mil at this, chill in their offices watching live video feeds of homeless people being exsanguinated on the hoods of their vintage sports cars, write up an investor report, and call it a fiscal year.

They borrowed and sold a record amount - they sold more shares, in fact, than are actually traded, far more than Gamestop's float. This shouldn't have been allowed to happen and probably means they were selling shares they never even bothered to borrow - naked shorts. (Where were you on that one, SEC?) Essentially, they were simultaneously betting on Gamestop going bankrupt and doing their best to drive them into bankruptcy. It's a good tactic when you need to find a way to pay for your old wife's alimony and your new wife's poolboy.

But it presents an opportunity for the savvy gamblers. Because these shares eventually need to be returned - after all, it does cost these funds money to borrow a share. And the higher the price goes, the more unstable it becomes, the more it costs to borrow. This means that at some point, they need to buy back those borrowed shares they sold.

All 140% of them.

So our visionary gambler, if they were to invest in Gamestop, would have a guaranteed buyer for their shares. And if millions of fellows were to ask their mother for an advance on their allowance so that they could buy Gamestop, too -

And then, if a famous e-commerce CEO were to buy a ton of Gamestop shares, join the board, and announce they're going to be a big company again by doing internet things and esports and radical new stuff -

And then, if a truly insane amount of call option buying - don't worry about it if you don't know - were to force market makers to rapidly buy up a ton of shares to fulfill all those options they sold in a wild phenomenon called a gamma squeeze that's basically the stock equivalent of an atmospheric microburst, suddenly spiking Gamestop's price to unheard-of levels -

- hang on, I need a new pair of pants -

Well then you'd have the perfect conditions for a short squeeze. The price is insanely high. There's a whole street of funds with deep pockets who absolutely must find a way to buy all those insanely expensive shares. And by buying them - 140% of the amount traded! - they're going to drive up the price even more. So one day, a fund will run out of money paying interest on their borrowed shares, and they'll have to drive GME's price through the roof buying enough shares to give them back. And as the price climbs, other short holders are going to be required to cover their borrowed shares by buying them. It's a runaway reaction where the more it happens, the more it happens. You know, one of those cute little phenomena like virus spread. Or nuclear bombs.

So who are they buying from? That's right. At what price are they buying? Well, that depends.

Hedge fund managers holding GME shorts would really, really like to convince GME stock holders to sell them some shares right now, before it climbs any higher, so that they can return the shares they borrowed and get out before they get steamrolled into bankrupcy. And they've got lots of tools at their disposal to do this: they can pump up other stocks to create FOMO, causing GME holders to sell their shares to go chase some shiny new meme. They can hire PR companies to astroturf these stocks on Elon Musk fan clubs and gambling forums. They can buy up shares and then, after trading hours are over, sell them in progressively cheaper tranches to drive down the stock price. They can wipe the hobo blood off their wattle and go cry on television about how they're being bullied. They can call up their investors, like Citadel, the company who processes all your orders, and tell them to stop letting people buy Gamestop while they try to drive the price down. They have, in fact, tried all of these things. But it hasn't worked - GME's price is higher than ever. It's out of control, now - there are too many people involved. There are other institutions involved, trying to extract maximum profit out of the shorts. The meme has reached critical mass.

Now it's a classic million-player prisoner's dilemma: every GME holder has visions of selling their shares for unlimited chicken tendies and cocaine dipping sauce. Maybe they think they alone can sell, while everyone else can continue to drive the price up by holding. But if every gambler thought this way, and sold their shares, very quickly the short squeeze wouldn't happen. Short holders would buy up all the shares being sold at a painful but manageable loss, they would cover their position, and the nuke would never be detonated.

What's a prisoner in this dilemma to do? At last, the point arrives. To avoid selling too early, the savvy  gamblers would wait until short interest - the amount of shares shorted out there - started to decline substantially. As long as nobody was defecting, nobody selling early, that decline in shares shorted would come with a spike in the price of the stock, as the few shares available are bought at astronomical prices. And this decline in shares shorted would distinguish this spike from gamma squeezes or regular old stock run-ups.

Then and only then, as the nuke goes off, the stock price ascends past Alpha Centauri, and the short interest finally starts declining, the short squeeze has begun. And then it's every gambler for themself.

However I’m hoping someone can educate me on this hypothetical.

If GameStocks board were to look at this opportunity to raise capital by issuing shares, how would that process look?

More shares would mean more supply, diluting value. BUT we could also buy more.
My question is more along the lines of what could Melvin and Citron and the hedge funds do? Is there any way for them to get the newly issued shares before general public? Does a share issuance need a set amount of time from announcement to sale so we can be properly notified and prepare? How is the price set?

My understanding is the GME needs to look out for its shareholders, so they can’t just issue shares at a lower price or anything. That wouldn’t be in the interest of us, the shareholders. So there would be no reason or way for them to issue shares below their current value.

Anything else I’m missing?

When do these hedge fund Wall Street fucktards actually have to start attempting to buy back all of these shorted stocks?

Obviously no one knows for sure but when they officially announce how much total GME stocks are short on feb 9th if I’m not mistaken won’t that be the most obvious time for this 🚀🚀🚀🚀to reach the next galaxy??

Can't post in WSB because of membership age, but I've got ideas and my only wish is that they make it to [r/wsb](https://www.reddit.com/r/wsb/) and I ain't no karma whore, so I don't care how they get there.

1. A  whole lot of platforms like Robinhood fucked us, and I want to fuck  them back. Most of these platforms have entrance gifts like free stocks,  often for the account opener and referer. While I have no fucking clue  how to do this I would love to see a way like IFTTT that would make it  easy for anyone to get a random referral code, fund their account with  $1 and have both positions sell their free stocks immediately and open a  window to leave a one star review. (the newly available funds can be  dumped into whichever shorted stock is within price range. THis would  have to be a hard and fast fucking before they shut it down but  Robinhood says that you can get up to $500 a year and if everybody's  grandma gets an account that could really fucking hurt, Tiktok for the  win? I wish we could leverage to the max and lose it all at their  expense like ""risk free money guy"" but unsure of likelihood.
2. Create  a corporation that we fund as possible to limit risk, just bankrupt the  corp, dividends paid to investors after charity for pr and optics.
3. The  shit is going to get ugly, but the short ladder tactic implies the  possibility of a reverse short-ladder? We need a way to effectively  counter attacks quickly within our legal limits, and push them the fuck  out.
4. SOme  people are going to want to sell out, that's their choice, but sell by  direct transfer to someone in this insane clown posse.
5. DREAM  ENDGAME: We take the whole fucking shell game down, not one comes to  bail them out, they have to eat their losses, the gov bails out the  citizens instead of the corps, the rules are changed to prevent another  09 and we all get a koenigseggs.
6. But  to do any of this we need help, help from everyone no matter if they  are WSB or not, young old and even boomers. We have to make it clear and  easy for them to understand our positions and what is happening, a  concerted effort, it's bigger than any of us. Notifications of important  events and new strategy. Build the fucking data cannon, pr, charity,  lobbying as possible, every free ad we can take out, we have to bee noob  friendly and elder friendly....

YOU FUCKIN WRONG CAUSE WE GOT SOME HOMIES ON DECK ROBINHOODS JUST A SMALL INDIE COMPANY COMPARED TO THEM

A PREFACE: DO NOT XFER OUT OF RH. THIS ADVICE IS FOR NEW BUYERS ONLY OR FOR THOSE WHO HOLD MORE THAN 5 SHARES IN RH AND WANT TO BUY MORE. ANYONE BOUGHT ON RH, DISABLE STOP LIMIT. DISABLE MARGIN, AND HOLD ON CASH.

Lets get this shit out of the way right now. The reality of the situation is Robinhood does NOT have the liquidity or capital to support buys any further WE GOT TOO FUCKING BIG!. GOOD! due to their clearing house being in house and run by baling wire and dreams. Their owners have a vested interest in ensuring they don't make the collateral demanded by the DTC to move the cash required.

So here's the fucking rub. There are two CONFIRMED brokers that will do anything in their fucking power to ensure we trade as much as we fucking want. They are...

🚀🚀Fidelity and Vanguard🚀🚀. You want to know why? They both own millions of shares in GME, do you think they won't do whatever they absolutely can to ensure collateral is covered on GME? They are profiting hardcore off of this. We NEED to be throwing their weight behind them, they are the ONLY future we have if we need to be backing this stock as retail.

This weekend, we need to push harder than we ever have before to educate people on this reality. Robinhood is bush league shit for processing this kind of demand, and it's time we take it to the big boys like Fidelity and Vanguard to handle the rest of this.

TLDR: Robinhood CANNOT SUPPORT OUR VOLUME. The ONLY brokers right now are Vanguard and Fidelity because they OWN GME SHARES. This is PERFECT for us. They will flip fucking gravity to keep us trading. PUSH ON.

Take this opportunity by the balls and never let go. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

I’ve seen some post on WSB saying that the person’s limit sell order was filled at ~2000 price per share.

Personally, I’ve seen the ticker shoot up very briefly to 4000+ for just a split second before it went back down and got halted. I thought it was a glitch at first but after seeing the post on WSB, I am more inclined to think that this is the pathway to the infinite money glitch.

How?

Spread the word and raise sell limits to 4200.69 or even higher. DARE TO DREAM BIG.

If enough people do this, the big guys have to buy at this price in order to cover their positions.

I assume this was the case with the price shooting up to 420 last week, since many of us put that sell limit so it was picked up by the algorithms that make trades for the big guys.

Therefore make sure you always keep an eye on the balance of risk and balance of assets in your portfolio.

One way to balance risk and reward in your investment portfolio is to  diversify your assets. This strategy has many complex iterations, but at  its root is the simple idea of spreading your portfolio across several  asset classes. Diversification can help mitigate the risk and volatility  in your portfolio, potentially reducing the number and severity of  stomach-churning ups and downs. Remember, diversification does not  ensure a profit or guarantee against loss.

GameStop is shorted into oblivion, &lt; 130% of the float, these shorts have made it an irreversible trade. 

In 2019 GameStop decided to buy shares back to counter aggressive short selling. Shorts reacted by continuing their aggressive shorting campaign into the buyback while GME purchased over 1/3, or 37 million, of their shares back under $5 without the share price as much as even flinching. This was a ridiculously large amount of shares which laid the ground work for what we are seeing today.

In buying back 37 million shares, suddenly institutional interest became greater than the amount of shares issued, which also created the situation where the amount of shares short went over 100% as well. While this was a bet on bankruptcy by the shorts, it was also a trade the shorts could possibly never reverse. I have read discussions on an infinity short squeeze and I believe that is exactly what we are seeing. Shorts had no choice but to continue shorting the stock and trying to defend their position. At this point unless GameStop issues shares that will allow short positions to cover I see no way out at any price for this reckless position to ever cover.",GameStop the Irreversible Short Trade #GME

There's a few good ones speaking out, some just giving lip service to be popular, and practically all of them in the pocket of big finance. You need a force to put pressure against the big money. We've got world wide media attention. You have the pressure in your favor now.

**This week Melvin stole half your value.** Probably more. The SEC should have halted after asymmetrical trade allowed the shorts to drive the price down with low volume bullshit. Everyone was focused on the end game and our wins, but think of it this way, they've already stolen from you. By halving the price, if it blows up to $2,000 a share, they cheated you because it should have been $4,000 a share. It would have skyrocketed even more because shares would be, at least, $600 right now based on our momentum (and that's without any squeezes) **They have upgraded your first class moon ticket to coach.** I saw a post saying the move saved them 6 billion. That money should have been ours.

We had the attention of the world, trying to help out cause. Don't give an inch Billionaires have already stolen so much from us. Contact your representative, tell them to intervene. Complain to the ref as the cheating is happening, not after the game.

I don't know what action they could take from a legal stand point, I'm an ape whose too dumb for that, but :

1. Even if nothing happens, **it won't hurt you.** If you've got time to watch a ticker for 5 hours, you got time to call. These things build over time start sooner than later. If we got 7 million redditors (and millions more lurkers) we could build a lot of political pressure. New White House means they don't want to look bad right away.
2. If the SEC, Clearing Houses, Melvin, etc. feels Congress breathing down their neck. **They are less likely to pull more dumb shit.** They assess the risk, so let's heighten the risk for them. If they feel fines might double, or regulation could be worse, they might ease off a little.
3. There's going to be lawsuits and committees afterwards. The political will is there for a politician to do more than speak out. **Start building your influence now.**

Don't give hedge funds an inch. Attack them at every opening, on the market and off.

Call them up. **Call!** It's more effective. It's the weekend, so you might have to leave a message. Tell them your name and address, say that Melvin already stole half your value. That they markets have been manipulated and something needs to happen now rather than later because they've already done damage to stock holders. That the SEC has failed investors by allowing asymmetrical trading that dropped the price from a $469 a share to $132 when investors nationwide were clamoring to buy shares.

You can call 2 senators and your congress person from the house of representatives. Call all 3.

I have no interest in GME, it looks expensive, but if nobody allows their positions to be loaned, then nobody can short and 

2) Fundamentals ultimately matter so if you really want the company to do well (long term) then everyone who owns the stock should become a customer of GME. Valuations are generally based on future revenue/profits. 

I lied, one more bit of advice, at least to novice investors, don't invest anything you can't afford to lose or leave locked up for years.

l8p22x,Seismasaur,2021-01-30 16:20:30,GME," 

“Americans have no culture. All you have is a mix of a bunch of other cultures.” This is what a non-American friend told me a year ago. In a sense she was right, but she was not diving deep enough. It was not by random selection that people from these other cultures ended up in the United States to create a random mixture of cultures. No, only people with a certain personality dared to cross the ocean and start a new life. This personality then morphed into culture.

So who were the people who risked what little they had to cross an ocean? Heck, cross a land-bridge thousands of years ago? Or on being freed, dared to try to make it in a hostile world? These were the risk-takers. The ones who had said fuck-it, sold everything or even indentured themselves, to buy one ticket on a rickety ship west. The ones who declared war against the largest Empire in the world because they were tired of paying high taxes. The ones who crossed a continent looking for gold.

That, my friends, is the American spirit. We are the people who love to wager on impossible odds. But our hope of winning is more than just a hope, it is sort of a madman’s conviction. And we get such a thrill out of it that we become proud of our brothers and sisters also daring to fight. Thus is born our pride.

But in recent years, we have begun to hate ourselves as the elite establishment has attempted to squash out this spirit because it is a threat to them. “If we get them to despise themselves then they lose their will to fight, or better yet, they will fight themselves while we get richer.”

So what did they do? They focused only on the dark aspects of our culture; on our racism, greed, and gluttony. They locked us up and tried to close our businesses. They told us not to take any risks, so we would feel unfulfilled and helpless. Now unable to make our own money, our endeavoring spirits crushed, they decided to give us 600 dollars to live on, while they gathered at restaurants in the middle of a pandemic, flew private jets during a climate crisis, and made billions.

You know what happens when you hate yourself? You eventually get depressed and stop caring. Or you become filled with anger. The establishment/the swamp/ the billionaire pigs fueled this anger using the media to stir the pot so we would lash out at one another and destroy ourselves with our misery.

But something happened last week. Suddenly, out of nowhere, people of all colors and backgrounds, the left and the right together, started singing, “Soon may the Tendieman come and send our rocket into the Sun.” Suddenly the common man was alive again and yolo’ing his life savings into a company the establishment had decided to crush. The American in us exploded outward all at once.

Suddenly no one really cared who said the r-word because it was understood to be a joke. The fear of angering one another over identity politics was gone because we were all on this rocket ship together. It didn’t matter if you be black, white, Asian, lesbian, gay (just no gay-bears), the Americans had decided to dream again. Pride came back in waterfalls. And surprisingly, people found they didn’t care if they lost the $600 they were so focused on last month. Their spirits had found their old spark, which was worth so much more.

The billionaire establishment is scared shitless. They tried to stop us. And just like how the British tried to stop the revolution, it just fueled our fire. Our sudden joy and vitality was contagious and our friends from around the world found the American within them as well. And the common man united against their true enemy by beating them at their own game called the stock market.

How many of you have also felt and sense of sudden, unexplained pride? Who suddenly feels alive again?",GME story has woken the dormant American spirit in all of us (even non-Americans)

# ​Summary: ​In the best-case scenario, GameStop investors could face massive losses when the music eventually stops because the company's share price seems to be divorced from its fundamentals. Revenue is declining, and the pivot to e-commerce isn't improving its bottom line. 

# In the worst-case scenario, GameStop investors could face losing their initial investment on GME but also other investments that they have currently.

# ​The details :

1/ ​GameStop could use its elevated share price as an opportunity to raise equity. But that won't necessarily benefit current investors ​those Who believe that the stock is worth $350 and will face dilution.   


​2/ ​The stock could also face regulatory action from the SEC (which is monitoring the situation) or from exchanges themselves, some of which have [recently restricted](https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/buying-stocks/articles/why-are-brokers-halting-gamestop-trading/) buying on GameStop and other volatile equities. 

​3/ 29.3% interest on loans to finance short position is not really an issue for two reasons: i)  the banks are not going to make it difficult for Edge Funds who are their main clients thru overnight repo. ii) Hedge funds are raising money by selling their long positions​. ​ ​You saw the indexes falling over the past 2 to 3 days. The arbitrage being made between how much money can you win on the situation ​where ​​$​22 billion of shorts going to $0.00 ​versus what you have to pay (a few dollars) to borrow the stock​. And for that very reason, they are not closing their short positions and more people are joining and becoming short​.

4/ How much money retails investors are willing to pony up to keep the price up or get it higher?:  Retail volume is 20% of the total. Do you really think you can win against 80%?

# In conclusion, this is no different from the other squeeze that happened over the past 50 years a few people are making a lot of money and the masses are losing a lot of money​.​ ​O​ption game is a zero sum game and for somebody to win you have to have another person who loses​.​",H O W D O E S A L L T H I S E N D?

*Processing img qq1cm0figie61...*

Logically it made sense that Robinhood was running out of capitol, until you do the math and read the 2 articles posted today about these firms being unable to meet the cash requirements. 

**First we examine the brokerages finances**  
 

TD Ameritrade - (2019 Average - 860,000 Trades per day, 11 million accounts and **1 TRILLION in net assets held by clients**.

(Data limited no IPO) Robinhood - (2020, 13 million accounts, 4.3 million trades, $150 billion in transactions.

E-Trade - (2019 - **398.6 billion retail assets** \+ 365 billion corporate service assets, Morgan Stanley purchased E-Trade to have a combined **3.1 Trillion in Assets**, in addition Morgan Stanley had **38.947 Billion** in free cash flow for 2019. )

Charles Schwab - (2020 - **6.69 Trillion in client assets**, Averaged 8.191 MILLION trades per day. 

eToro - (2020 -1.5 Trillion trade value cleared in a year... or **4.109 Billion per day**. 17 million users.)

&amp;#x200B;

**Next lets examine GME volume**

&amp;#x200B;

On Monday and Tuesday (25/01/2021 (DD/MM/YYYY) was at 177 million @ $100 a share, 

91 Million Wednesday @ $350 a share, 

and finally 42 million on Thursday @ high of 470 and average at 240 .

This adds up to 17.7 billion traded value Monday and Tuesday

31.85 Billion traded value Wednesday

10.08 Billion Thursday

**(Stick with me here)**

Now remember these companies are used to trading $GME at an average volume of 40 million a day with a share price of $10 or a net total of 4 Billion traded value. So in your head take out 4 billion from each of the total traded value of the stock for each day, and that is the numbers we are working with. 

Now compare this to Tesla, This year they experienced an average volume of 34.76 million. However their volume changed from the lowest over the year at 17 million @ a share price of 417.13, compared to the highest on the year at 222.13 million shares traded @ a price of $695. Those two numbers add up to **7.091 billion on their lowest day and 154.38 billion on their highest.**

**Now remember how we just saw that on $GME highest daily traded volume ever recorded they barely touched a change in value of 32 billion??? Yet somehow we see eToro, Robinhood, Charles Schwab, E-Trade and TD Ameritrade all restrict $GME because as they claim, ""They ran out of money"" So they can front the cost of 154 billion in a day for trading 1 stock but can't cover the 32 billion on a different day for a stock that has significant impact on their relationship with one of their banks?**

Now you tell me? Were we seconds away from igniting the largest wealth transfer in history? Were we seconds away from giving money to people who will give back, those who can help the single mother or homeless man on the side of the road because they aren't a billionaire themselves they are just another human who lives in a neighborhood, who passes the homeless man, talks to the single mother, works 12 hour shifts. We were seconds away from a wealth transfer not to a billionaire who will write a 40 million check to a charity that takes 80% for ""Admin cost"" but to you, me and every other person who has the ability and desire to change the lives of those around them for the better not just through a smile as you walk by or a bummed cigarette late on a Friday night, but through a physical way that only wealth can distribute.

Keep your head up, The math on this is simple, they are playing you. 👐💎👐

l8sb5k,sbash1,2021-01-30 18:38:17,GME,"**My Uncle, the Farmer is Exactly Like Gamestop**

My uncle was at one time a very successful farmer.  However, several years ago, things took a bad turn.  My uncle developed health problems that gradually got worse.  By the time the doctors came up with a good diagnosis, my uncle was struggling financially.  

To make matters worse, my uncle’s piece of crap neighbor heard of the trouble my uncle was experiencing. Instead of lending a hand to help out on the farm, that guy took out a life insurance policy on my uncle!  He figured not only could he end up with my uncle’s farm, he could make a profit at the expense of my uncle’s demise.  

This utter lack of human compassion did not stop there.  That same neighbor started contacting other neighbors, letting them know that they could also take out a life insurance policy on my uncle.  Most declined, but some joined in.  Then, all of those lowlifes hoping my uncle would go ahead and die, went to the bank and told the bankers that my uncle would soon be dead.  As a result, the bankers refused to loan my uncle desperately needed money that would help him get medical treatments and continue farming operations.

As a result, nobody who was in a position to help my uncle would.  Those who wanted to didn’t have the money to help with his treatments and they were afraid to go against the (evil) landowners who all hoped to profit off of my uncles death.

Well, I’m glad to say that today, things have changed.  I was just a boy when all of this started, but over the years and I my friends have saved up a fair amount of money.  We went to the bank and bought back my uncle’s mortgage on the farm. We provided the money needed to help cure my uncle’s illness.  It even looks like the farm has promise of once again being a prosperous enterprise.  To make things even better, as a result of my uncle’s good fortune, he has included each of us in sharing the profits from his farm.

But now we have another problem.  The cruel landowners who took out life insurance policies on my uncle now realize that aren’t going to profit off of his death and aren’t going to be able to divide up his farm among themselves. And they are outraged!  At this very moment, they are colluding  with  the town’s sheriff to say that the money we pooled to help my uncle should not be accepted and that the farm isn’t worth what we paid because my uncle was supposed to die and let the farm become nearly worthless.

We need your help!

Does any of this sound fair to you?  Of course not.

I don’t have an uncle.  This story is about Gamestop.  The hedge funds spotted a struggling business and made bets against it.  This made if even harder for the business to get necessary funding to transform itself. All of you are me and my friends.  We saw a business that others have bet against and have provided the funding, even more than is needed, to turn everything around.

Now, the hedge funds are crying foul.  They don’t like it that we decided to go against their evil deeds and they are trying to get the “sheriff” to refuse our money.  They are succeeding with some firms such as Robbinhood.   The word is watching.

l8spw3,Better_Cause,2021-01-30 18:56:01,GME,"There was a bunch of you yahoo's in voice chats the other day from Reddit circles talking about how this could potentially crash the markets this week. I don't know how realistic that is...

How realistic is it?

If they crash the markets over this, doesn't that mean the rest of the American economy and people will be hurt even worse, for a crusade that people are saying is for ""we the people"" or ""the little guy on main street.""

So how realistic is this?

If you all are using social media platforms to present social changes and help one another, shouldn't we be talking about how this ultimately can crash the markets, during a pandemic, when many people are hurting, just to make a point and lots of money?

Is that the same thing they are doing?

So how realistic is it that this stuff will crash the markets this week?

If that is the case, shouldn't we be thinking of how to ""protect"" the American public from both sides hurting us now?

Doubt anyone wants to have the real big boy conversations if anything I am saying because now it's about, ""Show me the money!"" 

Are folks running off the cliff with the rest of the Buffalo right now?

So how realistic is this?

Sorry to ask the difficult questions or not something anyone wants to realistically look at. 

But I watched that movie last night ""Get Shorty..."" 

Is this going to devastate the American economy like it already is? 

I am not sure the economy can take that kind of a hit right now with the pandemic. In fact, I am pretty sure it can't. I was already saying our economy can't handle the tidal wave from this pandemic, and now you all are talking about bankrupting the country further for a noble cause, or to be ""right"" versus ""correct?""

So many of the conversations have been around this is ""for the people"" in some way....are they sure?

Cause I am not. And if greed is going to continue collapsing my country, shouldn't I say something no matter which side is doing it now?

I heard a lot of disturbing conversations around the forums and inside chat rooms that sound more like the kids burning down our cities and writing the gross things on the walls, versus those of us outside cleaning it up after the damage is done saying, ""can you grab a rag now to help clean up?""

I am concerned about many things surrounding this, and many of you have your heads up your asses surrounding this Covid thing to begin with, and I know this for fact. So how do I know that these same mass blinded people are not handling this GME thing just the same?

So could this crash the markets this week like some people were saying? 

I honestly don't know enough one way or another to take an educated guess, and I consider myself somewhat educated, but not the sharpest crayon in the box for sure. I don't even suspect I would get serious folks that are invested in this that have a lot to benefit now. I would also assume many people won't want to discuss this ""if"" it was true. 

But at the same time, many of you said there is ""transparency"" on this side of the fence versus big wall street and Robinhood. Is that really true? I can't post in many forums and areas that are leading up the charges in this stuff, because I am not an ""insider"" yet. I don't have the Reddit qualifications to ask serious questions, when a lot of people have a lot of money at stake, and further, you all have congress people coming into the subject and talking with you all now too. 

So if there is so much transparency, then we shouldn't be able to ask the difficult questions, and at the same token, if this is about ""we the people"" like so many of you take this position on over this....then should we talk about the possibility of the markets crashing this week over this kind of stuff? 

Isn't that what is in the best interest of the American people? And if it is going to crash, then shouldn't we be protecting ""we the people"" and not letting a few people capitalize off this one way or another, and stand united to make sure the market doesn't crash with social media versus the other way around?

I am seeing an ""eye for an eye"" here, and I am told that never works out well.

His excuse is that other brokerages did the same thing too because their clearinghouses were at their limit. If that was the case, why not halt the entire market for everyone until all funds clear so hedge funds wouldn't short ladder attack?

They have clearly acknowledged that the stock is extremely volatile and I am sure they have enough brain cells to realize what would happen when you restrict buying for an extremely volatile stock. Knowing the obvious, they still went through with their decision. I just can't buy the whole ""clearinghouses were at limit"" argument since they didn't halt the entire market to actually protect investors as they claim to have done; if anything, they've damaged their investors.

&amp;#x200B;

My theory is that they will continue the restrictions onto next week to allow enough shorts to possibly cover their positions slowly. If not that, they will keep the price between some range to essentially kill the volatility, which would result in a significant drop in premiums for options. They want to force us to take profits and leave by doing this. 

&amp;#x200B;

I doubt the SEC will do anything until much of the volatility has died down. They'll continue to say they're ""investigating it."" Once the volatility has died down, they will jump in and slap these hedge funds on the wrist pretending like they're always on our side. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, if they do manage to kill volatility and premiums, all people would have to do is continue to diamond hand and possibly keep buying options to keep premiums high. They will try to demoralize shareholders. Remember, the stock market is mostly about psychological warfare rather than the actual fundamentals they claim. 

&amp;#x200B;

FFS their fundamentals always keep changing. If the small investors win this fight, they will simply readjust their ""fundamentals"" and claim that it is due to times changing (which wouldn't be wrong). But until they lose this fight, they will keep claiming that this market goes against their fundamentals. Remember, what happened with Tesla? Every one of these Wall Street schmucks kept talking about how overpriced Tesla was, only for them to come out and increase their price targets just last year because of ""fundamentals"". 

&amp;#x200B;

So, don't worry if the short squeeze doesn't happen this week. They know, people are hyped about next week and the best way to kill that hype is to make sure nothing happens.","All these brokerages claim they restricted buying because all funds had to be settled and their clearinghouse was at their limit. If that was the case, why not halt the entire market to keep everyone on even ground until all funds settle?"

Am I talking crazy, or is this possible?? Let's fight back!

Here's my thought.. If you are already looking to jump in for more $GME on Monday, execute your best buy price possible .. but then,

BUY JUST 1 MORE SHARE at like 10-15% ABOVE THE ASK PRICE.

If all 7M WSB people here just bought ONE (or more?) $GSM at 110% of the ask at the open on Monday, what do you think would happen? Especially with dollar-cost averaging of your earlier limit or market buy, you're ""overpaying"" what.. maybe $40-50? .. to help trigger a buying frenzy that could send the price past the moon by lunchtime?? That'd catch some attention, draw in more buyers, more price increase, rinse, repeat...

I've been here on WSB awhile, but mostly lurk. But, you crazy YOLO'ers hooked me this time.

This thought popped into my head, watching Cramer telling us we've already won.. take the home run and SELL $GME. Don't go for the grand slam, basically. This SELL hype will probably be pitched all weekend.. and the short ladder attacks are probably underway already. I have no idea what'll happen on Monday, but it'll be interesting.

BlackRock’s $3bn gain shows how GameStop could rally to ‘become like Tesla’

Passive investors are playing a big part in helping to fuel GameStop's rally and prevent declines in the stock

BlackRock, the world's largest provider of exchange traded funds, was one of the big winners from GameStop's surging share price 

By William Canny

Friday January 29, 2021 2:53 pm

The focus is on the Reddit army of small investors, but the explosion in passive investing has also played a big part in the GameStop market frenzy.

It's not just retail fueling the massive gains. Take industry giants such as BlackRock and Vanguard, who feature prominently among GameStop's top holders. Those firms have to hold shares of the company for their ETF products. As the shares gain, ETFs and other passive funds need to buy more stocks — these funds aren't able to sell the shares and take profits unlike stock pickers.",GameStop is way Bigger than you think!

l8vfxx,dutchaneseskilz,2021-01-30 20:53:59,GME,"**Wall street and hedge funds are utterly screwed.**

I've been a redditor for almost 10 years, rarely submitting posts or commenting, just mainly a lurker to read comments.

I stumbled upon some due diligence posts about GME over the past weekend on WallStreetBets, and decided to jump in on Monday at a price at $95. I still haven't sold, but with a stock price at $325, I could have easily tripled my money throughout the week and got out.

I mainly have followed the conservative investing subreddits, such as [r/financialindependence](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/), [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/), [r/personalfinance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/), which have suggested to invest in total stock market index funds, reduce fees, and enjoy my 7% return after inflation. After 6 years of this, things have been going ok, good, but not nutbusting exciting. I returned almost just as much from GME in this past week than from my entire 6 week working career. Granted, I know my GME earnings are fictitious, since I haven't sold yet and it can come crashing down (being a bagholder) at any point.

This whole week, I thought to myself, what sell target should I set? Since I consider myself a fairly conservative person, I would have been happy with doubling, or tripling my money and to not take part in this fiasco. After learning about infinity squeezes, I set my price target at $999.

After this past week transpired, I think here are some events that transpired that I think were the nails in the coffin for the hedge funds in wall street.

1. Viral spread of social media. EVERYONE is talking about GME. Everyone is going into WallStreetBets and taking a look. My boomer dad mentioned it to me last week, even before I heard about what was going on! Hedge funds have underestimated the power of virility of information through the internet and its exponential speed of growth. EVERYONE is buying stocks, all over the globe, from an already short supply of available stocks in the float.

2. Tweets from billionaires. Chamath Palihapitiya and Elon Musk, some of the most famous billionaries in the world!!!! Tweeted about GME. This is something that Wall street could have NEVER forecasted. This was the nail in the coffin for them, they never saw this type of exposure coming. Millions of people follow these billionaires, they are jumping in on the fun, and we have influential billionaires on our side.

3. Other hedge fund sharks coming in. Now that there is blood in the water, other hedge funds are joining in the party. They know what short squeezes are, they know how to put other funds in vulnerable positions and to play the odds. Not only do we have the power of [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) and the people of the ENTIRE world, but we also have the power of other whales. The enemy of our enemies are really going to be the ones to push us past the finish line.

I thought to myself, Melvin capital and these hedge funds guys, they're smart. They'll figure out a way to weasel out of this situation and STILL make money some how. But with the 3 big factors above, these are things that they could have never seen coming, which makes me think they are utterly f\*cked.

Now for exit strategy price target. I currently have a $1,000 price target that would trigger, allowing me to break even, and then another sell limit order at $1,500, that would 15x my money. Bear in mind, I consider myself a conservative average joe, and want to get in and out QUICKLY. So here is another data point for you guys, for what a fairly conservative person is setting his price target at.

I know everyone on WallStreetBets has crazy meme price targets of $69,420 etc., but this would just crash the entire economy. So I thought to myself, what would the max price target be without initiating government intervention? If the government gets involved, this could ruin the party for everybody. Can someone help me do the calculation, with a price target that would bankrupt only the hedge funds and market makers involved, and not the underlying banks that would initiate government intervation?

*Processing img i6nkf9ddaje61...*

Logically it made sense that Robinhood was running out of capitol, until you do the math and read the 2 articles posted today about these firms being unable to meet the cash requirements.

**First we examine the brokerages finances**

TD Ameritrade - (2019 Average - 860,000 Trades per day, 11 million accounts and **1 TRILLION in net assets held by clients**.

(Data limited no IPO) Robinhood - (2020, 13 million accounts, 4.3 million trades, $150 billion in transactions.

E-Trade - (2019 - **398.6 billion retail assets** \+ 365 billion corporate service assets, Morgan Stanley purchased E-Trade to have a combined **3.1 Trillion in Assets**, in addition Morgan Stanley had **38.947 Billion** in free cash flow for 2019. )

Charles Schwab - (2020 - **6.69 Trillion in client assets**, Averaged 8.191 MILLION trades per day.

eToro - (2020 -1.5 Trillion trade value cleared in a year... or **4.109 Billion per day**. 17 million users.)

**Next lets examine GME volume**

On Monday and Tuesday (25/01/2021 (DD/MM/YYYY) was at 177 million @ $100 a share,

91 Million Wednesday @ $350 a share,

and finally 42 million on Thursday @ high of 470 and average at 240 .

This adds up to 17.7 billion traded value Monday and Tuesday

31.85 Billion traded value Wednesday

10.08 Billion Thursday

**(Stick with me here)**

Now remember these companies are used to trading $GME at an average volume of 40 million a day with a share price of $10 or a net total of 4 Billion traded value. So in your head take out 4 billion from each of the total traded value of the stock for each day, and that is the numbers we are working with.

Now compare this to Tesla, This year they experienced an average volume of 34.76 million. However their volume changed from the lowest over the year at 17 million @ a share price of 417.13, compared to the highest on the year at 222.13 million shares traded @ a price of $695. Those two numbers add up to **7.091 billion on their lowest day and 154.38 billion on their highest.**

**Now remember how we just saw that on $GME highest daily traded volume ever recorded they barely touched a change in value of 32 billion??? Yet somehow we see eToro, Robinhood, Charles Schwab, E-Trade and TD Ameritrade all restrict $GME because as they claim, ""They ran out of money"" So they can front the cost of 154 billion in a day for trading 1 stock but can't cover the 32 billion on a different day for a stock that has significant impact on their relationship with one of their banks?**

Now you tell me? Were we seconds away from igniting the largest wealth transfer in history? Were we seconds away from giving money to people who will give back, those who can help the single mother or homeless man on the side of the road because they aren't a billionaire themselves they are just another human who lives in a neighborhood, who passes the homeless man, talks to the single mother, works 12 hour shifts. We were seconds away from a wealth transfer not to a billionaire who will write a 40 million check to a charity that takes 80% for ""Admin cost"" but to you, me and every other person who has the ability and desire to change the lives of those around them for the better not just through a smile as you walk by or a bummed cigarette late on a Friday night, but through a physical way that only wealth can distribute.

Keep your head up, The math on this is simple, they are playing you. 👐💎👐

l8wmv9,prqd112,2021-01-30 21:49:20,GME,"The hedge fund guys we are fighting are not even that bad of people compared to the really evil HF guys and our politicians. They did their due diligence and were making what would’ve been a good bet 5 years ago. They weren’t pumping, telling lies, then dumping. They were being truthful. They just got greedy by making too large a bet and not understanding the changing social media dynamics. 

The real threat here is an entire market collapse. As we saw in 2008, just one financial domino falling can lead to complete collapse. There are apparently even pension funds with a stake in Melvin. And even for firms without a stake in Melvin, some of their assets would tank in price if Melvin had to liquidate all their assets. Those firms may then have to liquidate some of their assets if they are highly leveraged, and the dominoes continue to fall. 

Fooled you. Market collapse is not the real threat. It’s a US dollar/treasury collapse. Ultimately, if the Fed wants to stop the carnage, they’d have to take assets onto their balance sheets by printing money. While printing money for stimmies and for bailouts and for welfare and to replace the tax revenue we lost due to COVID, etc, etc, etc. The DXY USD index has been falling since March and all assets have been increasing. China is now no longer buying US treasuries and is now SELLING them. The social security trust fund is now SELLING its treasuries because payroll tax collections fell so much during COVID, and it now needs to cash out to make SS payments. Russia and China are now doing some trade in euros, ignoring the current USD reserve currency system. China has its digital Yuan ready to roll out immediately to begin international trade without the USD. The USD slide will happen slowly, then all at once – when the smart money moves. Even deflationists like Raoul Pal, Jeff Snider, Brett Johnson, etc agree that hyperinflation is the endgame. We’ll have a brief severe flash of deflation during a liquidity crisis, but there’s immediate hyperinflation after that. 

No doubt a firm like Citadel would bail out Melvin if they can negotiate a large ownership position. But why do they demand such a high price? Because IT IS RISKY. If GME continues to rise, the parabolic increase in losses could even bankrupt Citadel. That is the first domino. In the latest Grant Williams podcast, Marc Cohodes posited that maybe Yellen is coordinating everything behind closed doors. She was paid $810k by citadel for speaking fees between her tenures at the Fed and Treasury. She is rich, and has many rich friends in financial institutions. Did she go to RH and Citadel in private? Did she promise Citadel a bailout if the deal doesn’t work out? Is she terrified of a market/USD collapse? Are Melvin/Citadel still massively short? Maybe. It’s an interesting thought experiment and certainly possible. 

What we are battling for is to have this collapse now. So that we may enjoy the rest of our lives in a sane economy, built on solid fundamentals. Where our hard work results in rewards. The boomers think they can live out the rest of their lives within this bubble, at the expense of their children. Billionaires who exploited our financial system think they can make it to death still believing their riches came from improving resource allocation. 

As we have seen, the smart money is no longer just on Wall St. It’s spread across the middle class too (on WSB).

l906h1,nape_wants_a_biscuit,2021-01-31 00:39:08,GME,"We were within approximately 30 seconds of triggering a nuclear bomb that would have blown up the market. Do I have your attention?  Here goes:

1.	⁠⁠⁠Yesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570.  Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again?  Really?  We've been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock.  This creates upwards pressure on the market.  We've been seeing these movements all week.
2.	⁠⁠⁠Yesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and spook retail investors into a mass sell-off.  It didn't work.
3.	⁠⁠⁠Last night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options.  You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so.  Very interesting and the first sign of pants-shitting fear.
4.	⁠⁠⁠Today, the market opened very strong.  It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570.
5.	⁠⁠⁠At approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move.
6.	⁠⁠⁠Two minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling.
7.	⁠⁠⁠The trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.

Okay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this: The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it.  What does that mean?  It means they ran out of shares and/or capital. They wouldn't let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market.

I saw an unsubstantiated post from a user (u/zshub) who said a market sell order executed at $2600 for him.  Do you get the severity of the situation, if that's true? It means the buying was getting to the point where it was just about to put INFINITE pressure on the price of the shares.  It means virtually any ask was getting bid.

How do you get infinite upwards pressure?  A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted.  The call writers need shares to hedge.  Retail is still buying more.  The short sellers need over 100% of the float back.  Add these together.  There were more shares needed than existed on the open market.  That's what a liquidity crisis is.

Listen to this to this remarkable (if infuriating) interview where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn't have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home.  DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO ""PROTECT THE MARKET""? Hello!  He's not talking about the market for GME shares.  He's talking about the entire market!  The New York Stock Exchange.  The NASDAQ.  All that.

Remember the movie Snowpiercer?  Do you remember that scene where the lower class people realize the soldiers who oppress them have no bullets?  Go to the 1:00 minute mark of this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o

It kick starts a full blown rebellion.  They have no bullets.  It's the exact same in this market:  No capital.  No shares.  Infinite losses inbound.

TL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, ""Do I get my tendies now?"" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares.  Do you get that?  HOLD.  Like the guy in the movie, scream, ""They're out of bullets!"" and create a stampede.  That's how we win.

They needed your shares so badly that they literally risked PRISON TIME to get them.  They tried robbing you, and I'm not even exaggerating.  They were within 30 seconds of all being wiped out today.",Repost retardo

THIS IS A REVOLUTION. For decades wall street has profited off our backs, manipulated markets, crashed our economy, and laughed the whole way through. For the first time, we've collectively agreed its time to end this trend and expose these frauds for the scum they are. We are a decentralized force hell bent on putting the power into our own hands. Ironically, robinhood has been stealing from us and giving to the rich. We've been stuck with crummy stimulus checks while big money gets all the bailouts and billions, when the fact of the matter is that we are busting our asses just trying to survive.

We are in an unprecedented movement that is actively fucking these turds in the ass, and they're crying themselves to sleep just like we have for years. This is about more than greed and personal gain, this is about equality for all and punishment for the ones taking advantage of us. Our movement transcends the singular person, we are a force that cannot be stopped. I've never been prouder of us retards. This is for all of us who sat at home and despaired at the fact that we knew the system was broken, wishing we could make a change. Well, we're doing it you stupid monkeys.

Tl;dr: Retail GME gang has a phreaking captain crunch style 80’s hacker white hatting to help counter the assholes trying to fuck the thesis up.

Tl;dr of the tl;dr: PEPE SILVIA IS TEAM GME, AND GALDALF WRITES CODE

So anyway, by this point you should know (if you’re watching GME and related topics as obsessively as I am) that some crazy shit happened on Friday afternoon: despite massive (presumed) efforts by the shorts to drive the price of GME down, it more or less held and closed above $320 (great news for all the call holders). Idiots who were watching the Level 2 data and actually know what the pretty lines mean suggest that it was pretty apparent that some big and smart money was countering every move the shorts made

( see [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8x0rq/we\_cant\_win\_this\_war\_on\_our\_own\_but\_we\_have\_a\_big/glf1f2f](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8x0rq/we_cant_win_this_war_on_our_own_but_we_have_a_big/glf1f2f)  )

You should also know that we have some anonymous Viking avatar tweeting mysteriously about being on Retail’s collective side, and seeming using an algorithm and a $638million pile of money from “over 130 activist investors” to counter the selling pressure and invest in GME. “Up to the mountains we had walked to take our leave of the world below. We turned back for a final glimpse before the crossing. We saw the suffering of men; a system that only benefits the few. No one will forget January 29th, 2021. On this I swear. Witness the reckoning.”

That’s super cool and all, but the better tweet is this one (posted about 5 hours after the one quoted above): “When life gives you a bully you can bleat or become the backstop. 35 years in the industry to use my greatest creation as a reminder to the proteges of their clients. Was everything from then until now for this one moment to bring meaning to a synchronicity? So it begins. $GME” Below the text is a snippet of code that looks like a buy order (ianno I just press buttons)

([https://twitter.com/KjetillStjerne/status/1355078099403231232](https://twitter.com/KjetillStjerne/status/1355078099403231232))

My theory is that the viking is Josh Levine, who helped invent modern high frequency trading (Island ECN) but also watched most of the people he worked with be consumed by greed (and even donated $1mm tendies to the SEC at one point, himself.) I’ma quote from a 1999 Wired article ([https://www.wired.com/1999/07/island-2/](https://www.wired.com/1999/07/island-2/)): “Island's origins date back to 1988, when Jeffrey Adam Citron, then 17 and fresh out of high school, met Josh Levine, a 20-year-old college dropout. They bumped into each other at Datek Securities, a small brokerage firm, where Citron was a low-level clerk and Levine was a casual contract worker.”

So a few things real quick: no, this Citron guy doesn’t seem to have any relationship to the other Citron we all know and…. are aware of. Dude paid the SEC $22.5mm in the same settlement that Josh got caught up in, but here’s the thing: “Levine \[…\] agreed to settle this matter, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint” but Citron was “barred from association with any broker or dealer.” Basically, as far as I can tell Levine just wrote the code and Citron and the other dudes used it to do shady shit. (links: [https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr17930.htm](https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr17930.htm), [https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/34-47323.htm](https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/34-47323.htm), [https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2003-5.htm](https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2003-5.htm))

The other thing to note here is that 35 years ago was 1986, which is two years before Levine met Citron, and Levine was 20 when they met.

OK so back to the Wired article, let’s take a look at who Levine is: “Asked who he might admire in the financial world, he answers, ""Admire is a pretty strong word to be using in the securities industry.""

Such barbs hint at a reservoir of conviction in Levine's work. He routinely speaks of making Island's mission clear to ""the people."" He cares about making good software and knocking down market barriers. What he envisions is a ""pure auction"" market - much like the days when buyers and sellers met in the Tontine Coffee House or in the open air along Wall Street to trade in centuries past.

When pressed, Levine espouses a pragmatic manifesto for a marketplace that would be libertarian (markets should be fair by design, so they don't need regulation or monitoring), democratic (the more participants, the better), and rational (usage fees should be reasonable and encourage participants to behave in ways that are good for everyone). But despite the explosion of ECNs, the new access afforded by technology, and the SEC's strong actions, Levine remains unimpressed by the progress toward his ideal marketplace. ""So far I haven't seen anyone do anything strikingly bold or brave,"" he says. ""Most are just reacting to the changes that technology forced upon them. Myself included.""”

What this all means is that

1.) This guy kicks ass (and if he reads this I’m sorry, because I get the feeling you’ll hate this)

2.) Dude has been around a while, he’s been in town a while, he threw it down a while, and the town threw down on him

3.) He has the money, Lebowski, but he doesn’t give a shit: while Citron was buying a Gulfstream (go check the Viking twitter bio location) Levine was getting married at Coney island and living in an apartment next to his sister near the Brooklyn Bridge. He describes the money he earned as “Definitely enough for my family and me to live happily ever after”

4.) Dude is kinda like us (from Wired): ""I first got involved in programming because I sucked at sports and girls didn't like me,"" Levine recalls. ""I got involved with programming for a securities firm because they had a computer and I hated going home to my lonely apartment.""

5.) FUCKING HOLD THE LINE, BACKUP HAS FUCKING ARRIVED. THIS IS EVEN BIGGER THAN WE THINK, NEXT STOP IS THE RESTAURANT AT THE END OF THE UNIVERSE",Theory: Backup arrived on Friday and this thing is even bigger than we imagined

!HOLD AMC! Explaining why down below!!

IMPORTANT NOTICE ABOUT AMC AND WHATS GONNA HAPPENS ON MONDAY

Now this poster is brilliant. Read it understand it pass it along. PLS READ AND SHARE SO EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THE NEXT PHASE:

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) : AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us)

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that.

Today’s target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they’re forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher.

But this isn’t even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher.

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there’s a lot more room to grow. On the high end we’re talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday

My recommendation:

1.	⁠HOLD
2.	⁠Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because it’s going to violently rise
3.	⁠Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when all the shorts expire and the price is at it’s highest.

I am not a financial advisor nor a registered stock broker. I simply have done my DD (Due diligence) and reflecting on passed events. Every stock has risk but it’s all about risk mitigation. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity so be mindful what you’re dealing with. If you have any questions I will try my best to answer them.

As you have probably heard, the GME stock has went through the roof, and this is because of a certain subreddit (the one your on right now). GameStop stocks have been falling for several years, and are at an all time low because of the COVID-19 pandemic. GameStop has been falling behind because of the new way to buy games online from home. This is no different than going on Amazon Prime and renting your favorite movie instead of driving across town to rent a movie from a store. This new trend of purchasing games online has led GameStop into a downward spiral. This can be seen in the price of its stock. At an all time low, GME stock was at a price of 4$ in March when the pandemic began. Due to a sudden outbreak in buying because of social media apps like Reddit and Twitter, GME stocks have been through the roof because of the excessive amount of people buying this certain stock. For example, you find a coupon for 10% off the new iPhone 12, with no limits on the amount of times this coupon can be used.  The phone costs 700 dollars, you buy the phone with the coupon, sell it at market value and pocket the 70 dollars. You do this 10 times in one day and you made 700$ dollars. You use this 700 dollars to buy more phones to sell and you make 700 dollars a day. One month you will be sitting on 21,700 dollars. Enough to buy a new car. One year after this you have earned 260,400 dollars, enough to buy a house in the suburbs. Let’s say Apple is Hedgefund and the phones are stocks, but instead of you selling the phones to someone else, you are returning them back to Apple for the full 700 dollar price. This means Apple or Hedgefund is losing 20 dollars every time you trade in a phone. This starts to become a problem for Hedgefund because if a million people all bought one share, Hedgefund just lost 20 million dollars. I hope this helped explain the situation a little.",An explanation of the GME prices

What's the likelihood/possibility of hedge funds like MM shorting stocks they would sell if they liquidated in order to cover their short positions, essentially compounding the amount they get from liquidating?

Assuming that when they sell their other stocks the value of it will go down, as is happening across markets already. Could they not reap rewards off of the crashes that are occurring? Is that a thing?

They have already proven they're willing to do anything if it made a difference to how much they can shrink their losses by doubling down on their GME shorts.","If hedge funds liquidate to cover their short positions, could they not short those stocks as well?"

But if for whatever reason it goes the other way and all these autists are as strong as they appear based off of all thst I've read and been following...then I have a chance...sometimes we just need one chance...and it's a chance that I can have money aside for my two kids...to buy enougj insulin supplies for my son who has type1. A chance at perhaps paying down the house a little so to help ease every months bills weight. It's a chance. If you all have a lot of shares since lower price...please please 🙏 hold and buy more and keep holding to help us little guys have that chance. We aren't even buying wanting to be rich...we want to just have a little extra to pay off student loans, bills...and a little lift to our lives.

If you follow the current debate about GME, wallstreetbets and hedge funds you will notice that the real root of the problem is not being discussed. It is shown as a war between hedge funds and small investors, it is, but that is not the cause but the result.  The root cause is the SEC allowing naked short positions. That is a violation of the Constitution because it disregards property rights.Because with naked short positions hedge funds can determine the capital value of a company. But, only the shareholders' meeting of a stock corporation is allowed to do this. In this way, small successful companies are massively depressed and then taken over at the sell-out price.  The SEC's task would be to prohibit this practice and to monitor this prohibition.But in recent decades this has been deliberately neglected, with the result that thousands of companies have gone bankrupt and investors have lost hundreds of billions of dollars.  The war of the small investors on reddit shows the effects that such an unjust action causes. Maybe this fight will bring about a change but probably it is like in this fairy tale, everyone sees that the emperor has no clothes on but only the retarded scream: he is naked!

Wouldn’t limit buys help to build a support where those ladder attacking the stock would try to avoid that price support? It does show the other side what price people would be buying at, but it would also deter them from trying to attack to a certain lower price because long buyers would be happy to scoop up shares and hold.

I think if you want to jump in GME immediately, buy some now and also set buy orders at a cheaper price to build a strong base and to get cheaper shares if these attacks do continue.

l9cdgu,DirtyRuscoe,2021-01-31 13:33:43,GME,"I am an idiot. This is speculation NOT guidance.

Know one knows exactly what is going to happen next, but this is how I think it could look.

**WILL THERE BE A SETTLEMENT?**

I don't think so. 

But, according to one post I saw on here (NOT FACT CHECKED) the hedge funds can only afford \~$1500 per share (average). Anything beyond that and they will go bankrupt. In theory the liability will then transfer - but whether that happens is another matter.

My speculation is that IF there is a settlement offered - forcibly or otherwise - it will be in the region of $500-1000 per share. That, for most of us, would represent a decent profit. 

**WHEN WILL THE SQUEEZE START?**

The hedge funds are hoping they can divide our ranks and force us to panic sell before they have to cover their shorts. That's why we HAVE TO HOLD FOR AS LONG AS IT TAKES. Every day the hedge funds are waiting they are racking up millions in extra interest so there WILL be a tipping point. That may come some point next week, it may be well into February. In their shoes, I would want to wait as long as possible to spread doubt and create as much fear as possible to trigger panic selling and reduced expectation. 

**HOW WILL I KNOW WHEN THE SQUEEZE HAS STARTED?**

Two ways - one will be the obvious rocket in stock price, combined with live/recent data showing the decreasing outstanding short volume. 

The other will be seeing everyone go into meltdown on this sub.

**HOW LONG WILL IT LAST?**

Most current data suggests the hedge funds will have a 'days to clear' (the time it takes to clear their short volume) of between 2.5-6 days. The lower our willingness to sell - the longer this will last, the more eager we are to sell - the quicker this will be. As we will all be very keen to exit I think this will be on the shorter side of that estimate - but the squeeze will be long enough for everyone to 'comfortably' exit their positions.

**WHAT SHOULD I DO DURING THE SQUEEZE?**

***\*THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE - YOU SHOULD MAKE YOUR OWN JUDGEMENT\****

If you haven't already realised, you should be planning to exit your position during the squeeze. The squeeze will be when the hedge funds are forced to buy the stock from us on our terms (within reason). ***DO NOT SELL BEFORE THE SQUEEZE STARTS***. 

**WHAT WILL THE PEAK BE?**

This is pure speculation. I think that we will hit \~$1000 early on in the squeeze. We will watch as the diamond hands of many of our fellow retards turn to paper at this point - and set this as their sell point. What may follow will be a dip to anywhere between $500-800. From this dip, probably the next day, the price will rise again when the hedge funds hit the next wall of diamond handed retards. I speculate this will be the true peak - and will fall in the region of $2000-6000. This peak will not last long. 99.9% of us will miss it. Make your peace with that now. You will be too greedy or too slow. You cannot possibly know that the price you are looking at is the highest it will get until its gone. Even if you did it is likely that the sell order you place with your broker will take too long to catch this peak anyway.

It will only take one or two huge sales to crash the price back down to $500-800. I am sure you will join me in hoping DFV exits at the peak.

I think the price will then remain relatively stable at this level for the remainder of the squeeze. This is where the majority of us will exit our positions. 

Then once enough of the shorts have been covered the price will nosedive to a more representative market value which I would estimate to be between $20-50.

**WHY $2000-6000?**

That's just my guess. We hold the power. If we all refuse to sell under $10k then *that's* the price. But I think plenty of hands will turn to paper before we get to that. 

**HOW DO I EXIT IF I AM GOING TO MISS THE PEAK?**

Everyone needs to decide for themselves what represents their best option and what they would be happy with - in a realistic way. 

Some may want to sell a % of their stock at a lower price to cover their initial investment and then set sell orders to sell the rest incrementally at price points they are happy with. 

Others may want to play diamond hands to try and catch the peak with their entire holding.

The important thing is to decide what you want to do, and stick to it. 

You need to be happy with what you end up with one way or another. If you risk it all and lose, or if you sell out at $900 and then watch the stock zoom to $8k you need to remember your plan. No one knows what will happen, be happy with how you chose to play it. 

**WHAT WILL HAPPEN AFTER THE SQUEEZE?**

Like soldiers after a war, or the music festival when Monday arrives, we will all go our separate ways leaving a trail of destruction in our wake. 

The GME price will hit market value, hopefully we have all made a tidy profit, and GME strengthens as a company.

**FUCK IT, I'M GOING TO STICK IT TO MELVIN BY HOLDING GME FOREVER!**

...That's NOT how to stick it Melvin. That's how to stick it to yourself. Sell during the squeeze and if you really love the stock, buy back in when the stock crashes to market level after the squeeze has squoze.

**WHAT SHOULD I BE DOING RIGHT NOW?**

HOLD! HOLD! HOLD! and wait patiently for the madness to begin!

Good luck to everyone, I hope to see you all driving lambo's on the moon!

Gambling? In the Stock Market? I'm Shocked.
Mentioned:	GME
By James Mackintosh 

“I don't think we need to worry too much about the rough-and-tumble world of WallStreetBets leading to massive capital misallocation, either. Over time they'll learn not to gamble what they can't lose, or they will lose it. Plenty of weird things that conflict with efficient markets are regarded as perfectly normal and acceptable, including stocks having price momentum or the Santa Claus effect. We can learn to live with a few more bizarro stock moves thanks to Reddit, and eventually the market will return to caring about profits.”",Saw this as encouraging this morning....

I am an idiot. This is speculation NOT guidance.

Know one knows exactly what is going to happen next, but this is how I think it could look.

**WILL THERE BE A SETTLEMENT?**

I don't think so. 

But, according to one post I saw on here (NOT FACT CHECKED) the hedge funds can only afford \~$1500 per share (average). Anything beyond that and they will go bankrupt. In theory the liability will then transfer - but whether that happens is another matter.

My speculation is that IF there is a settlement offered - forcibly or otherwise - it will be in the region of $500-1000 per share. That, for most of us, would represent a decent profit. 

**WHEN WILL THE SQUEEZE START?**

The hedge funds are hoping they can divide our ranks and force us to panic sell before they have to cover their shorts. That's why we HAVE TO HOLD FOR AS LONG AS IT TAKES. Every day the hedge funds are waiting they are racking up millions in extra interest so there WILL be a tipping point. That may come some point next week, it may be well into February. In their shoes, I would want to wait as long as possible to spread doubt and create as much fear as possible to trigger panic selling and reduced expectation. 

**HOW WILL I KNOW WHEN THE SQUEEZE HAS STARTED?**

Two ways - one will be the obvious rocket in stock price, combined with live/recent data showing the decreasing outstanding short volume. 

The other will be seeing everyone go into meltdown on this sub.

**HOW LONG WILL IT LAST?**

Most current data suggests the hedge funds will have a 'days to clear' (the time it takes to clear their short volume) of between 2.5-6 days. The lower our willingness to sell - the longer this will last, the more eager we are to sell - the quicker this will be. As we will all be very keen to exit I think this will be on the shorter side of that estimate - but the squeeze will be long enough for everyone to 'comfortably' exit their positions.

**WHAT SHOULD I DO DURING THE SQUEEZE?**

***\*THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE - YOU SHOULD MAKE YOUR OWN JUDGEMENT\****

If you haven't already realised, you should be planning to exit your position during the squeeze. The squeeze will be when the hedge funds are forced to buy the stock from us on our terms (within reason). ***DO NOT SELL BEFORE THE SQUEEZE STARTS***. 

**WHAT WILL THE PEAK BE?**

This is pure speculation. I think that we will hit \~$1000 early on in the squeeze. We will watch as the diamond hands of many of our fellow retards turn to paper at this point - and set this as their sell point. What may follow will be a dip to anywhere between $500-800. From this dip, probably the next day, the price will rise again when the hedge funds hit the next wall of diamond handed retards. I speculate this will be the true peak - and will fall in the region of $2000-6000. This peak will not last long. 99.9% of us will miss it. Make your peace with that now. You will be too greedy or too slow. You cannot possibly know that the price you are looking at is the highest it will get until its gone. Even if you did it is likely that the sell order you place with your broker will take too long to catch this peak anyway.

It will only take one or two huge sales to crash the price back down to $500-800. I am sure you will join me in hoping DFV exits at the peak.

I think the price will then remain relatively stable at this level for the remainder of the squeeze. This is where the majority of us will exit our positions. 

Then once enough of the shorts have been covered the price will nosedive to a more representative market value which I would estimate to be between $20-50.

**WHY $2000-6000?**

That's just my guess. We hold the power. If we all refuse to sell under $10k then *that's* the price. But I think plenty of hands will turn to paper before we get to that. 

**HOW DO I EXIT IF I AM GOING TO MISS THE PEAK?**

Everyone needs to decide for themselves what represents their best option and what they would be happy with - in a realistic way. 

Some may want to sell a % of their stock at a lower price to cover their initial investment and then set sell orders to sell the rest incrementally at price points they are happy with. 

Others may want to play diamond hands to try and catch the peak with their entire holding.

The important thing is to decide what you want to do, and stick to it. 

You need to be happy with what you end up with one way or another. If you risk it all and lose, or if you sell out at $900 and then watch the stock zoom to $8k you need to remember your plan. No one knows what will happen, be happy with how you chose to play it. 

**WHAT WILL HAPPEN AFTER THE SQUEEZE?**

Like soldiers after a war, or the music festival when Monday arrives, we will all go our separate ways leaving a trail of destruction in our wake. 

The GME price will hit market value, hopefully we have all made a tidy profit, and GME strengthens as a company.

**FUCK IT, I'M GOING TO STICK IT TO MELVIN BY HOLDING GME FOREVER!**

...That's NOT how to stick it Melvin. That's how to stick it to yourself. Sell during the squeeze and if you really love the stock, buy back in when the stock crashes to market level after the squeeze has squoze.

**WHAT SHOULD I BE DOING RIGHT NOW?**

As we approach the possibility of becoming the rich, it is VERY important that we do NOT turn into the very predators that we so despise. We don’t want to change seats in a money-based system that reinforces aberrant behavior, we want a system that has equality built into it. A man named Jacque Fresco talked about changing our money-based system into a non-monetary one that he called a “Resource Based Economy”.

PLEASE EDUCATE YOURSELF ON THIS.
It is so crucial that we do IN CASE we end up in another depression. People NEED to know what to demand for in times of change, and another money-based system is NOT the solution. It was ok hundreds/thousands of years ago, it is completely unnecessary today.

Any other system will INEVITABLY lead to the same problems we face today: unnecessary hunger, homelessness, murder, theft, rape, sex-trafficking, and the MANY other issue we face today. A “Resource Based Economy” will remove almost all of those problems. The following link will direct you to the film that expands on the concept of a RBE. We NEED to raise awareness as we fight corruption.

**TL;DR** GME/AMC have a chance to piggyback on community support. Not only survive, but reinvent and become something bigger than they EVER could without us. Stop thinking $1000/$100. Be thinking about leaving these stonks for your grandkids in 50 years!. Think like you are collectively the new-age decentralized and democratically-ran HF that is helping these companies build the next Amazon, TSLA, or Google. These two companies can transform into something as big as Google or Amazon if they play cards right.

*Not financial Advice...just common sense*

**To Adam Arron - CEO of AMC,**

Are you listening? We got your back. So what are you planning to do about it? I've been thinking for a month about what **should** you do to save AMC, with our help. We did the hard-work and won't stop but now you need to step up. Your deal with Silver Lake to wipe out $600m was a good start. Wipe out 10% debt...let market absorb the 15% dilution, and keep going letting the shorts foot the bill. We watch the numbers. We know your stock is 79% sold short (44.7/56.6m), 2nd only to GME. We know you are being left for dead by the HF. We have no intention of letting that happen (#SaveAMC). We have given our support, but you have to return the favor.

We know where you are in Leawood. We know who you are. We know your rank and file employees are people like us. We know you want to survive. We want you to survive. Do not even think about making a deal for a secondary with HF like D1 Capital. You might get cash but you will go the way of RH. *You need us more than we need you*. We are the largest Hedge Fund in the world. Don't believe me? Then believe [Chamath](https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1355580731980869637).

You have a choice. ***Reinvent AMC*** by converting enough debt, slowly, to shares ***with lockups.*** Then negotiate *exclusive* partnerships with the DNA (Disney/Netflix/Apple) of new entertainment media to provide the ""*get away*"" experience we still need sometimes. Covid will subside. Traffic will come back. Not everyone pays for all 3 of the DNA streaming services. You have kitchens and liquor licenses in your locations. You have people to cleanup after us. We can relax and chill. We will come.

But don't stop there. With your newfound partnerships and lower debt-load, attract new very long-term debt (10-year) with attractive rates. Use that money to money to rip out those stupid section of chairs at floor-level no one uses. Replace it with fully networked raised flooring, ready to hookup gaming stations, and partner with $GME to establish the e-Olympics of eSports. Brand it. Be the exclusive venue across the world for all regional national qualifying events for every popular game that will ever be developed from now until eternity. Then every 2 years hold the Super Bowl of eSports, the e-Olympics. Sell advertising to the world. Corner that market. If people say it won't work, tell them you got the room, the bar, the big screen and tech to stream, and the partnerships to go global and no one else has the money to catch up. Sell exclusive merch. Let us come in and yell, scream, be rowdy and cheer on locals fighting to make it to the big stage each year or to the global stage every 2. Give us the chance to let lose and make local heroes and celebrities out of our team as they compete. Be the company brave enough and bold enough to usher in the new world of interactive entertainment of eSports.

You got the equipment, the room, the setups....now, thanks to us, you have the opportunity. If you need help figuring out the details, you know where to find me. We got your back, do you have the brains to do something with it?

Sincerely, Your Future

**To George Sherman CEO of Gamestop,**

Are you listening? Read our letter to AMC. We got **your** back too. So what are you planning to do about it? See what AMC did? See what RH did? Which path you going to take? RH was on the way up, before they screwed up. We know they had issues, but in their attempts to survive, they got in our way. Bad mistake. Look at AMC? They didn't make a deal with the devil (HF). They didn't bail out HF betting you would crash and burn. Do not even think about making a deal for a secondary with the Hedge Funds. We hear Melvin Capital and Citron supposedly closed out, but others stepped in to try to destroy you. You might get cash by doing a deal with the Devil but you too would go the way of RH. *You need us more than we need you*. We have grass-roots support and big names believe in our power to make a change for the better. Don't believe me? Believe [Elon](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1354174279894642703)

Let me quote Daniel LaRusso in Cobra Kai (quoting himself from Karate Kid quoting Mr. Myagi)

&gt;""Live or Die man?""

Let me repeat, we have your back. Be smart. We have given our support, but you have to return the favor. We know your rank and file employees across America are people like us. We know you want to survive. We want you to survive.

You have a choice. ***Reinvent GME*** by converting your debt, like AMC, slowly, to shares ***with lockups.*** You're debt is &lt; 3% of your market-cap. Sell just enough stock to erases your debts and give you $2b to reinvent. That's &lt; 10% of your market-cap. You will have HF lining up to go long if you pitch a ""*stick it to your competition*"" angle combined with the billions in free press you would get. Use that money to outfit half your store floor-space to mini-streaming venues. Most your stores are in strip-mall locations. You can probably take over **more** space if needed. Establish a 10-year partnership with AMC for the e-Olympics branding. Every weekend, you can run ""local qualifying events"". You can make technical partnerships with the DNA (Disney/Netflix/Apple). They have the streaming infrastructure. You just have to hook-in. Let them handle the details of programming access to ""local content"". Let them do a revenue-share as you become a massive content provider the second you flip on the webcams. That's a massive revenue stream. You can sell lower-priced regional subscriptions for local content. There's another revenue stream. You can charge entry fees to cover costs and more. That's a 3rd revenue stream.

A little bit of due diligence here and I’d like to paraphrase by saying I’ve been trading for a year and self educated via the internet. Not financial advice I just like the stock. 

All figures are via finviz.com

GME short ratio is 2.34 meaning on average shorts have 2 days to cover their positions. 

Currently there are ~50M in share float (total available common shares) and still 60.5M shares sold short equalling a short float of still 121%. 

What does this mean? On Tuesday if the price of GME remains unprofitable for the shorts they will need to buy back 60M shares. 

Now, this is more or less common knowledge amongst GME investors, and if say for simplicity, 50% of investors are not willing to sell, then this leaves only ~25M shares available for shorts to repurchase and close their positions.

In 2008 the largest short squeeze of all time occured to Volkswagen with 6% of share float and 12% short float. Volkswagen was briefly the most valuable company in the world by market cap after a near 500% pump resulted. (200€ to 999€) 

Note the near identical 2:1 ratio of share float to short float.

If half of us degenerates refuse to sell, there is massive upside here. Minimum 500% maximum 10,000%.

If nearly everyone holds, the latter occurs and Gamestop will effectively be worth more than the entire US economy. (current mkt cap 22B*1000 yields a new market cap of 22 trillion. Us gdp is 20.8 trillion. 

Setting my limit sell at 10,000% or $325,000

TLDR: There is a clear path to Gamestop being worth more than USA. In 48 hours and u/deepfuckingvalue will probably be able to purchase the moon if he so wishes.",There is a clear path to Gamestop being worth more than USA In 48 hours

The New York Times article ***How Wallstreet Bent Steel*** chronicles how Relational Investors turned a company and a community upside down. The outcome will shock you!

[See article: How Wallstreet Bent Steel](https://www.nytimes.com/topic/company/timken-company)

By the fall of 2012, Relational investors was well on their way acquiring Timken stock. Then the hedge fund made a textbook move: They partnered with their publicist, CNBC, and sent Jim Cramer to The Timken Company to do a remote broadcast of Mad Money pumping the stock.

[See article: Jim Cramer visits The Timken Company](https://www.cantonrep.com/x493673651/CNBC-s-Jim-Cramer-in-Canton-visits-Timken-Co)

l9h9wn,zachv1017,2021-01-31 17:38:21,GME,"Hi guys, 

I have been studying the options chains for GME over February and have noticed some very interesting things I would like to raise. Would love to hear everyone's opinion on this matter.

Going to clarify very early on - this is not financial advice.

The points: 

1) put volume is way above call volume - there don't seem to be many calls thst physicallyel exist. At first this seems to just suggest that people want to buy puts more as they think GME will crash. However Put prices are way down. People do not want to buy the puts. Doesn't make much sense eh? 

I think there is a very simple explanation for this - as we know brokers have been trying to mess around with margins - they don't want us trading on leverage. I suspect brokers have stopped offering us call options, the risk is to high to the entire financial system. 

2) a very simple indicator - call prices are up. Between 20% and nearly 200% with the average being around 50% up!!! This is with expiry dates moving closer aswell - which we know reduces option prices. 

3) put prices are way down. They are already much cheaper than calls - and they're failing even further. You can pick up puts with strike 40 - 60 ish for 1.5 =&gt; down from 2.5+ a couple days ago. The average fall in price is around 30%. 

4) interesting the price increases for calls are bigger up towards the much much risker strikes - around 100%. Obviously this becase the are now ITM but I think on Monday we should monitor them again - further increases suggest an even more bullish sentiment on the GME price and suggest a squeeze is very likely. Take for example a 320c 5/2. They now trade for 125 with a healthy 2600 of these options out there. These options are suggesting that the price is going quite abit north of 445. Investors are willing to pay 12.5K. With such a high risk option we are going to assume investors want 4:1 returns. (The higher the strike price - the higher the risk - the more an investor is going to want a huge return to ""pay off"" for the risk they took) this works out as exactly 50K profit. Adding this into our calculation they need to exercise the option for 62.5K to earn back the initial cost and make this profit. That gives us a price of $945. This obviously could happen exactly as I've stated it, or they could lose all of their 12.5K or they could make way over 62.5K. Either way I think the options market is incredibly bullish on the price. 

This was not financial advice. I do own GME.

l9iqno,cohiba2929,2021-01-31 18:41:19,GME," I remember 2008 and the situation was really unbearable at the Estate.

1/ Two of our upstairs maids - Milly and Henrietta - and Andy the second cook ploughed their life savings for a deposit on five condos in Miami Beach. They were so paper rich for a few days so they decided to leave us. Mother was really distraught and kept saying ""those girls you train them and then they leave you"". 

2/ Then It became really miserable. Three of the stable boys left to start an investment newsletter. The horses had a really hard time and became very very depressed.

3/ Patrick the gamekeeper was very loyal as was his father. But his new girlfriend, Tiffany, convinced him that if he didn't cash all of his retirement accounts she would leave him. So they took the money and bought an option for the parking lot at the bottom of a new condo tower to service the minimart and yet to be constructed. The colour drawing was very appealing - Tiffany liked the landscaping very much. They got the reassurance that the Republican mayor would approve the construction: And you know you can trust those guys, Absolutely.

4/ Then something really funny started happening the developer asked Andy and the girls to come up with the principal for the payment of the 5 condos or they would lose their option to buy. They didn't have the cash to exercise so the options became worthless.

5/ The stable boys got in trouble with a psycho lawyer for giving financial advice without a license. They took the first flight out to Marseilles and enroll in the French Foreign Legion under assumed names. 

6/ The condo tower was constructed but remained empty and started to decay because most of the options expired worthless - Nobody got the principal to buy and there were not enough occupants to pay for the fixed charges. Dad received a phone call from the developers when they started offering three condos for the price of two. He passed.

The two Maid, Milly and Henrietta decided to stay in Miami and became exotic dancers. Andy came back to the great relief of mother because his cooking was most traditional and mother never liked anything ""Nouvelle"".

l9jc7t,kingarthur8888,2021-01-31 19:07:24,GME,"i've played this market game for awhile now.  taught myself everything by trial and error (mostly error).  the benefit of all those errors - was to learn how to spot (and avoid) pitfalls.

i am FAR from a market expert, but i have become a fairly advanced skeptic.  the 3 things that i have probably learned the most are:


1)  imho, the market is as crooked as it gets.  the one percenter's have been playing this game for a very long time.

if things were fair...  certain trading platforms would not be able to stop you from purchasing shares.  do you think this would happen to the ""already billionaires"" if the roles were reversed?

2)  enough will NEVER be enough - in this game.

3)  i feel 100x better - gathering $100 to $300 a few times a week, than i do being up $6000 in a day and losing all of it?

4)  i try to remember how much i make for 8 hours of work each day.  if i can make that much (or a bit more) in 45 minutes playing market games, i'm happy.  the little amounts add up.

5)  there is ALWAYS another OPPORTUNITY right around the corner.


all that being said, i still hope you ALL tbe best of luck.  i have a total of zero shares in any stocks right now, but i would still LOVE to see GME go to +1000 points.

funny enough, GME is the very first stock i ever bought.  it first hit me when i took my nephews to a local store, and saw the hoards of people trading in their games for next to nothing, and then buying a different used game for 4x that amount.  i bought GME stock way back when it was around $16 and sold at $44.  ha!  i still dont even remember how i went about opening an account.

i do have questions though???

i feel like i was late to the game on this OPPORTUNITY - bummer.   🙁

i still decided to go through A LOT of the most highly shorted stocks today, and it looks like they have all been played.  almost every single one of them has the same chart pattern as GME.

for example...  take a look at NAKD for example.  1/27 = 2.2 billion shares traded.  1/28 = 1.1 billion shares traded.  and so on...

and, this seems to be the case with a lot of these heavily shorted stocks.

1)  does this mean that the REDDIT community was dominating ALL of these stocks?

2)  are all the members of REDDIT, already millionaires, with a vast network of computers that can perform all of these trades, within a matter of seconds?

3)  and let's just pretend that the ""ultra-rich"" have already started manipulating these stocks to best benefit them...

why not take the killer gains that you made on GME - cash out - and start fresh again.  start with another stock that is closer to $5, rather than one that is as high as GME?

i don't know about you, but i could buy a heck of a lot more shares at $3.50, than i can at $350.


just food for thought.  good luck to you all!  i want nothing more than to see EVERYBODY get rich!   🤑🤑🤑

I tried downgrading from RH Gold so that RH can’t lend my shares to the DTC, Brokers, or costumers.
Different phones and accounts (friends with me), all were unable to. When you select the “downgrade” option there’s a UI bug where once selected the pop up closes out and you still are signed up.

I emailed support to transition back to a standard cash only account. Is this intentional? Something extra to add onto all the shit RH has fucked up this week? Does anyone else have this issue?

It would be in their best interest (or maybe citadel LLC not securities(!)? Or maybe even the DTCC?) to enable the short counterfeiting in hopes to supply the short demand that is being used for short ladder attacks and high cliff drops (see the 500 drops).

It also enables folks to continuously use instant transfers thus providing more liquidity to RH (imagine all the people who have signed up for gold to get in on GME quickly). There have been huge liquidity concerns, e.g. 1b emergency cash transfusion to cover SEC minimal liquidity holdings.

Edit1:
I just tried through their desktop UI and I get the following error

“Request has been terminated Possible causes; the network is offline, Origin is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin, the page is being unloaded, etc.”

No SS since I’m worried about privacy/metadata

Edit2: Finally was able to downgrade through desktop UI(I’ve been trying since yesterday night).",Is RH Restricting RH Gold Downgrades? I think so!

I think the idea that this could cause a global economic crash is becoming more and more substantiated. It is not our fault for playing the game and winning, but none the less we will receive part of the blame.

The hedge funds are becoming vindictive and angry. It is no longer about GME, it is about their pride and they are willing to destroy the entire economy to stay ahead.

This does not mean we should let them win. This has escalated beyond a single, or a few, tickers and is now about the financial security of pretty much all Americans.

It is time for this to stop and be arbitrate by lawyers in a boardroom at which we have full representation for the shares we own.

That is not giving up. We can still sell our shares for slices of the moon, but we cannot allow the US economy to be a casualty of this war. As much as it deserves to crash, we know from experience that it only hurts the marginalized and poor. The hedge funds will walk away with golden parachutes and our parents will end up kicked out of their houses.

This is no longer a game, this is business.",We are approaching a catalyst

I say don't be selfish and sell the cause to secure some small profits. Yah I said it (SMALL PROFITS). If you're in it fore money then ride this thing till the end and you'll have much much more trust me. But if you sell at 1000 or what ever else we will loos and many might loos big time, And the hedge funds will win. We hold and buy more until the shorts percentage on this stuck get to 3% or lower. then do what ever you want, cause only then we can say we won.    We just won a battle but the war is still not finished. So I say let's make them pay more and more until they give up and learn not to mess with people lives.

Maybe I am extremely stupid but I have a few lingering questions about the whole GME saga that I can't shake. Between all the fucking rockets and diamond emojis, I can't seem to find the answers. 

First: positions GME shares @ cost $90 holding indefinitely. Why? Because I like the motherfucking turn around 

1) the days to cover is out of whack because daily volume is way up from average. With the reported mass algo trading volumes, how the fuck are we to tell when they are actually covering? If I was a hedge, I would ram high volume shit trading between ourselves one day, get he volume to 100m, then for the next 5 days, actually fucking cover. Can someone eli5 how this is not happening?

2) shorts outstanding. I've seen numbers like 130% tossed around liberally. I've seen various sources of numbers, but one thing is pretty clear...most figures go back to Dec. 31 then extrapolate back from there. Also saw key data dates being Jan 27 and Jan 29. Does anyone have definitive evidence of current updated shares outstanding?


I guess the overarching question is this: Melvin and citron both said the covered. Most of the people here say it's impossible because it would have driven volume. Which I agree, but volume has been driven higher with some motherfucking massive candles at open the past week. So why is everyone so confident they haven't covered at least the majority of their shit?

l9piir,NurpNurpSlurpSlurp,2021-01-31 23:53:08,GME,"With the recent GameStop short squeeze I've been reading a lot of the same sentiment, no remorse for the large hedge funds and the super rich. It's clear how crooked and broken the system is for the everyday, hard-working, general population. It’s rigged and it’s designed for us to fail.

Are we destined to live our lives paycheck to paycheck while the uber rich are out purchasing their third $100 million vacation home?

Does the average American not deserve the American dream, the white picket fence, and frankly, a life more worth living?

It‘s not fair and is downright disgusting. They are shitting on America, the American people, and what America was designed to be. Why are we protecting them, why are we letting them get away with this?

Because of this movement, the increasing division in the U.S., the dated two-party system, and a potentially new Trump-inspired party, I believe it’s an ideal time to establish a new political party. I’m fairly certain it would gain traction and could have a lot of potential and support if it focused solely on the average American and not the super rich.

The party must be strongly rooted in financial topics and focus greatly on decreasing the income gap and providing better financial stability for everyday people. Normal, everyday people should establish and maintain it, literally giving “power to the players”. At the current time, all other non-finance related political issues would remain status quo as much as possible.

In such a hypothetical party, here are some proposed solutions that could help level the playing field:

1. **Remove money/corruption/lobbying from politics.** This is mostly aimed at keeping politicians in line and accountable for their finances and actions. Such measures include setting an income cap for politicians, forced retirement/stipend after political service, open and public financial records, easier entry into politics by normal people, easier removal if they fail to keep the public’s approval, and harsh penalties/jail time for corrupt and law breaking corporations and politicians.
2. **A flat tax rate, based on income.** Everybody/corporation pays, no exceptions, no deductions. Potentially have tiered levels with different rates; the more you make the higher your rate. For example maybe income up to $500k could be one rate, $500k-$2mill would be a higher rate, and so forth. Number of tiers, income level, and tax rate would obviously have to be determined.
3. **Raise minimum wage to a reasonable living level.** The current rate is not sustainable and not livable. Companies can afford to pay their employees more and if prices do go up, the market will dictate what is important and what is worth paying for.
4. **Employee based profit sharing.** The lowest paid employee must be within a certain percent of the highest paid employee, or meet minimum wage, whichever is higher. For example, it’s not fair for a CEO to pull in $50 million/year while their lowest paid employee only makes $9/hr.
5. **Impose automation fees/costs.** This would hopefully limit companies from automating all their labor to avoid paying the higher employee wages. For example, if McDonalds didn’t want to pay their workers more money and replaced them with machines, they would need to have a cost associated with that decision, potentially an hourly cost as well.
6. **Mandatory high school courses: Finance and Decision Making.** The finance course would teach basic finance concepts such as budgeting, financial planning, mortgages, entrepreneurship, stocks and investments, etc. The decision making course would help educate and teach students on how to properly research, analyze, and weigh outcomes, to help make them make conscious decisions both large and small. Life is a series of nonstop decisions, so it’s important we know how to evaluation our options.
7. **Be better at creating/improving/regulating/making efficient, government agencies who oversee/implement/and enforce the laws.** Currently I believe there are a lot of inefficiencies in these agencies and there is a lot of room for improvement. Case in point, Amazon and other large companies not paying any taxes. I’m not sure if these problems are because of lack of funding, accountability, oversight, or corruption, but the agencies need to be fixed and carefully evaluated. Definitely a specific branch dedicated to the super rich and corporations.
8. **Government budgeting/spending.** What a complete cluster f\*. I think a lot of our issues could be resolved with proper and sensible government budgeting/spending. For example, do I own a Ferrari? No. Why? It’s simple; I don’t need it and can’t afford one. I know I’m simplifying and it’s a complex subject, but the government needs to take this approach as well.
9. **Other potential matters that I feel are important but too tired to expand on.** No corporate bailouts. Income/area based caps and/or limiting prices on healthcare/insurance/pharmaceuticals/education/real estate.

I understand achieving and implementing these solutions would be extremely difficult and realistically maybe even near impossible. But I think it's important to realize that any progress or steps in the right direction, are better and more important that not trying.

2. I’m not invested in GME.
3. I’m not a Financial Advisor and this is not financial advice.

**Ancient Mone**y (**AM**) hasn't been this awake since WWII. During that period **AM** stood, watched and plotted as humanity tore itself to pieces whilst acquiring more and more assets. **AM** allowed the war to stop when their gullets were full. They also profited by funding a European infrastructure re-build. Think about that. An uncontrolled, phenomenally resourced entity that has the capability to influence a world war with the technology available in the 1930s. Control of the behavior of a population is now trivial for **AM,** they control the message content, source and distribution. **DO NOT BELIEVE ANYTHING YOU SEE OR HEAR IN THE COMING WEEK**.

**AM** have had a full weekend to plan the next steps and will use all available resources and assets to prevent the projected losses from occurring.

* If this happens and you sell, they could watch the price plummet and see their gains come back.  BUT when it trips the breaker and you have  💎🙌  and hold the ----&gt;&gt;&gt;price goes up,

again, i hope GME goes through the roof.  no!  BLOWS THE ROOF OFF!!!

but, here is real deal...

there are a handful of other stocks out there, that are being mad-shorted, just like GME.

im seeing the Nation of REDDIT being divided!

check out NAKD, EXPR, SENS, CLVS, and many others.

ALL heavily shorted, and ALL way cheaper.

check the message boards of other highly shorted stocks, here on REDDIT!  (you can find a list of nearly all of them by a simple google search)

each one of these stocks has its very own bunch of ""TIRED-OF-THE-SAME-OL-ESATABLISHMENT""  ""EQUAL-DISTRIBUTION-OF-WEALTH-IS-NEEDED-NOW"" pumpers!

now, don't get me wrong.  i am right there with you.  this is game changing stuff that is happening right now.  and i DIG IT!!!  👍👍👍

but divided, we fall...

i just wish i had the resources (and smarts) to be able to UNITE all of us to stand behind one stock at a time.

don't fall in love with a stock.  stocks are not what they were made for - anymore.  now, they are just tools to make money.  plain and simple.

if you were lucky enough to get in on GME when it was below $10 - then you will understand just how much more could be made with a stock like NAKD, or one of the cheaper sticks.

we need a LEADER to direct us all to the SAME cause / stock.


1st example...

buy 100 shares at $5 per share = a $500 investment

if those shares jump to $300 per share = your investment now equals $30k

your profit being = $30k - $500 = $29500.00


2nd example...

your same $500 to invest in GME (currently at $325 per share) would = less than 2 shares that you could buy.


2 shares at $325 a piece = a total of $650 to buy them both

then if GME goes up to $1000.00

your 2 shares would then = $2000.00

but, dont forget to subtract your initial $650 investment from the total...  ($2000 - $650 = $1350.00)


i don't know about you, but i'd like to be a part of example 1.  haha!


lastly...  just for the beginners...  a quick tip on how short selling works.

1)  all the big money was betting against GME.  they were BEARISH on the stock.  they thought the price was going to go down.  they MAKE money the price going down.  they LOSE money if the price goes up.

2)  to bet against a stock - you SELL first, and then BUY back when you think the price has gone low enough.  (dont worry how that works for now - just remember a short-seller SELLS first, and BUYS second.

3)  everyone here was doing just the opposite (and actually, what stocks were initially meant for).  everyone here is BUYING first, and then SELLING second.  most people here are BULLISH on the stock.  we want it to go UP.  BUYING causes the stock to go UP.

4)  so, when everyone here was BUYING, BUYING, BUYING... the price was SHOOTING SUPER CRAZY HIGH!!!  haha!  this means that the ""ultra-rich"" guys were losing money like crazy.  they were freaking out!!!  WHAT DO WE DO NOW MORTIMER!?!?!?!

5)  what did they have to do, to stop losing all that money?  how could they get rid of their stock shares that were losing them into the BILLIONS of dollars?


you guessed it yet?


6)  they had to BUY back the shares that they initially SOLD, because they were short on GME.  and, yes...

7)  all of the BUYING back of the shares that they did - gets counted, just the same as the type of BUYING that everyone here was doing.

8)  so, all of ?REDDIT's? BUYS made the stock go UP!  and all of the short-seller BUYS made the stock go UP even MORE!!!


we, ""the united masses"" could do this all of the time - if we were all on the same page / stock.


GOOD LUCK TO ALL TOMORROW!!!  I HOPE GME HITS 5000+!!!

or better yet...

if we all got in on a $5 stock that goes to 5000+!!!",STILL WISHING YA'LL GOOD LUCK!!!

l9tyma,brownstevemcqueen3,2021-02-01 03:45:26,GME,"DOCUMENTARY PITCH: For the people funded by the people🎥🚀

Title: Power to the players:the short 

Themes: Unity, reform 

WHO AM I

My name is Damien Santillan, I’m a twenty two year old independent filmmaker based out of Southern California 

STORY

Power to the players will be a documentary film about how money in the pockets of the people is better for society. It will advocate for teaching market literacy to disenfranchised communities, reforms that protect retail investors, and collective activism. On top of that it will highlight how unity has helped the American people more than their government, which has failed them.

(lack of financial relief, lack of free medical care, lack of free college, lack of pto, a minimum wage not on par with inflation, and lack of taxation on the rich)

2020 showed us that our government's interests serve the 1 percent. The story of gamestop and Wall Street bets is one of perseverance, corruption,hypocrisy, courage, and unity. 

This sub reddit unintentionally started a movement against the 1 percent. People have called this a war, a war in which the common man can win. We’re about to witness the biggest redistribution of wealth, from the 1 percent to the people, the world has ever seen.   

WHAT IS NEEDED

Ideally it would be great to hear from the deepfuckingvalue. He’s the biggest winner and the man to start this all. With all due respect he isn’t crucial to this film because this movement is bigger than one man

I want to display those who are using gamestop gains in life changing ways. Examples being those who: Will be paying for medical bills they can’t afford, college, parents retirement, rent food, parents using that money to take time off to be with their families,people who plan to give back to their communities and people who lost everything due to covid.

Most financial advisors recommend investing 10-15,averaging 12, percent of your annual income. It is also said not to invest in money you can’t afford to lose. Most who believe this also believe in the 50-20-30 rule, 50 percent to bills, 20 percent to savings, and 30 percent for discretionary items. These numbers add up to 112% which just isn’t fucking possible, unless youre a hedge fund shorting a company.

 A part of our problem is that the people who make up these numbers are out of touch with reality or have a stake in the game. For the sake of argument, let’s say that people have to choose to invest their savings because they can afford to lose it, we all know in reality they can’t but stick with me.

 The average monthly income in America is about 3000 a month. We need a surplus of 600 for a savings.

Rent is 1400
groceries 255, 
used car 393
car insurance 199
utilities 140
internet and cable 135
phone bill is 70
medical bills or insurance around 456
Credit cards 123

We’re already at 3100 without the 600 left for savings

I left out things quality of life things and other variables like gas, entertainment, dining out,student loan debt, random emergencies, fines, and more because you get the point

That was doing a lot to prove that i can use a calculator, but I said all of that to say this. We would also need to hear from credible sources from market analysts, economists,historians, sociologists, government officials, progressive activists to break down all the factors that led up to this movement, why it needs to continue, and how we can make the stock market more accessible to the poor and lower middle class. 

The one percent, people born into their wealth, crafted this narrative that you can get rich with hard work and investments which just isn’t true. We figured out how to beat them at their own game and now they’re moving the goal post. This is why I say this movement is bigger than one man. Our strength will be found in numbers and education.

FUNDING

Here’s the not so fun part. I initially wanted this to be a self funded passion project. As I wrote this the idea today it got bigger and bigger. I then I realized my 11 shares of game stop won't be able to get this project to its true potential.

I could potentially do it but it would be on a much smaller scale,be dependent on how next week is, and take significantly longer. It also wouldn’t beat the level this story deserves. That's why I am inviting the Wall Street bets moderators to reach out and collaborate with my creative partner and I to discuss sourcing and handling the financing.

I understand they have another creative project in the works but this is another route that can and should be taken. 

There isn’t a bigger fuck you to big money than creating this with the money that we took back from them.

 If that fails and you're interested in donating to this project you can email silverbackcinema@gmail.com


WHY ME?

I’m sure this sub-reddit and twitter is flooded with filmmakers chasing this story for clout despite having no stake in it. I’d be lying through my teeth if I said I didn’t say that I see this as a great opportunity to launch my career. I’m the person for this because of the way I see the world. I've seen my parents struggle, I’ve been unemployed, I’ve worked 60-70 hour weeks, I’ve dropped out of college twice,I don’t come from money, I’m familiar with adversity, and I understand the power of believing in something. 

I’m a risk taker, I’m ambitious, I’m not a financial advisor, I’m not giving financial advice, I hold shares in gamestop, I believe in this movement. This is my story as much as everyone else’s and I am burning to tell it. I possess the same spirit and fight that this community has.

  **POINTS**

* **Robinhood will continue to limit trading on Monday in short-squeeze names like GameStop.**
* **The millennial-favored stock trading app has cut down its list of restricted stocks from as many as 50 on Friday to eight on Monday.**
* **The eight names are GameStop, AMC Entertainment, BlackBerry, Koss, Express, Nokia, Genius Brands International and Naked Brand Group.**
* **Customers can still only buy one share of GameStop’s stock and five options contracts.**

you cannot trust anything you read from the so called 'official' sources anymore, all information is being manipulated to push an agenda which more often than not, doesn't include you.

fundamentals, short interest, analysts reports, mass-media coverage, experts of any sort: telling you what makes sense and what doesn't. I know it's appealing to your mind, it's meant to do so, fight it. try to feel what's right and what's wrong, your gut works very well more often than not.

if you want to really understand (not the stock market) but all the Capital Markets, there's only 1 bible written by frank fabozzi. still the bible doesn't cover all the frauds happening in the markets via proverbs, teaches you only the fair and efficient rules of the game.

please, for the love of god: stop letting people influence you so easily, I know it's hard to develop 'critical thinking', but seriously sleep well, hydrate, and think for yourself or your life will become a nightmare, sooner than later.

&gt;all data available out there about short interest, loan fees etc could be false, you'll never predict accurately when is the right moment to sell. also b/c you know: 💎🤲

there's only one strategy that works, and it's called 'faith'. trust your gut and your instincts and stop being greedy: risk little, win big or risk big and lose little.

when you calculate your odds of success, decisions become easy:

downside: if you invest $300 and the stock goes to $1, you've ""potentially"" lost $299 (you don't sell, you don't lose).

upside: from $300 to $500/$1,000/$5,000/$69,420.69/infinity

as you can see you have little downside and very high possible upside, which makes this a very good bet; even if the stock goes to $0 and gets delisted you took a good decision and shouldn't be ashamed in any shape or form of having lost a good bet, which has the odds stacked in your favor.

make sure that fuck-face of your broker doesn't dare to sell your shares for you, hence don't use margin on high IV stocks, only cash positions and keep some cash as collateral (5%) in case your broker goes crazy and decides to charge you something unexpected and liquidate your shares w/ a bullshit excuse. (you're right, he's not your friend).

use LMT (limit) orders ""ALWAYS"", for example what I did for myself is this:

* BUY 50 GME LMT $300
* SELL 2 GME LMT $500
* SELL 4 GME LMT $1000
* SELL 8 GME LMT $5000
* SELL 36 GME LMT $69420
* BUY 1 CALL GME 19'Feb $500

that's it, very simple order strategy. you have everything automated for you except the CALL option.

what about the next play? THERE IS NO NEXT PLAY, stop listening to all the mfers pumping their agenda, if you want to diversify: do so, but do it b/c you like a stock not b/c someone told you GME is over. GME is not over, we like the stock, we keep it. the GME story is really starting to unfold only now.

✅ - Create a Fidelity brokerage account or a brokerage account with a platform that did not block or restrict trading.

✅ - Authorize an account to deposit money into Fidelity. Fidelity offers up to $25,000 in instant deposit credit.

✅ - Withdraw any money currently not invested but deposited into Robinhood &amp;amp; other Brokerages restricting trading.

✅ - HOOOOLLLDDD your Robinhood AMC &amp;amp; GME stock.

✅ - Setup live market pricing on Fidelity. In the app, go to More... ► Settings and Profile ► Quick Access ► Turn on Watch Lists &amp;amp; Real Time Quotes. This feature is turned off by default and means Fidelity has a 15 minute delay on live ticker prices.

✅ - Activate “Extended Hours Trading”. This allows you to trade on the markets before and after close for a set amount of extended time. To do so, you HAVE to be on the Fidelity website. Search in the top right hand search corner “Extended Hours Trading” and pick the article titled exactly that. Walk through the process to enable it. Others are saying to call Fidelity. Don’t. Customer service simply walks you through how to do it on your own from the Fidelity website.

✅ - Rate Robinhood a 1-2 on the app and playstore.

✅ - Rate Fidelity a 3 or 4 on the app and playstore. 5 star customer service but they deliver a 2 star experience on their god awful UI. Let’s do this to help convince Fidelity to modernize their brokerage app platform &amp;amp; leave Robinhood in the dust.

✅ - File complaints on Robinhood using SEC. Link

✅ - Class Action Lawsuits. If you believe you were negatively impacted by Robinhoods actions and believe you are entitled to compensation. Begin browsing r/ClassActionRobinhood for further information. Only sign up for the class action you believe has the strongest case. Don’t sign up immediately either. Allow the legal firms to continue developing their cases before determining the strongest.

Wall St has got us by the balls! Those assholes are laughing at us now because they think WE GOT OURSELVES TRAPPED! They think that we're only in it for the short squeezes and that's it!

BUT WE HAVE TO PROVE THEM WRONG. WE HAVE TO CONTINUE HOLDING NO MATTER WHAT! DIAMOND HANDS IS NO LONGER A MEME - IT IS A FUCKING REALITY!

Why? Because now, there's something else at stake here: OUR VERY FUTURE AS RETAIL INVESTORS AND TRADERS.

Let me explain: The SEC and our elected officials are currently looking into us - what they're thinking is that we coordinated this mania to squeeze the shorts. NEARLY EVERYONE who holds political power is wondering if the people who bought in to these meme stocks early are going to dump on those who bought in at the all-time highs. ALMOST ALL OF THEM are under the SPELL of Wall St and THEIR historical crashes. If we sell and crash our stocks - IT'S GAME OVER FOR ALL OF US.

I HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE FUCKING SERIOUS IN MY LIFE. 

IF we sell and crash our stocks, we can potentially cause MANY, MANY new investors to get hurt in the process. WE CAN'T DO THAT - IT'S AGAINST THE LAW; it's called a pump and dump by the SEC. If that happens, you can bet your asses that there's gonna be NEW LEGISLATION introduced to FURTHER REGULATE US. THEY WILL EVEN FORCE REDDIT TO SHUT DOWN WALLSTREETBETS IF THEY HAVE TO. If things get apocalyptic on the market, our elected officials will be turning to the big players on Wall St  for guidance, and they will all point their fingers at US. The hedge funds and the institutions will make damn well sure to RESTRICT US - and future generations - FROM TRADING THE WAY WE WANT TO EVER AGAIN. And if that happens, Wall St will have won the ULTIMATE VICTORY over us - by having the government muzzle us as they continue to rig market the even further for themselves. In fact, they will rig the stock market SO HARD that it will just become another tool for them to rob us!

BUT NOT UNLESS WE CAN CONVINCE THOSE IN POWER OTHERWISE... BY DIAMOND HANDING OUR PRECIOUS STOCKS. WE HAVE TO STOP LOOKING AT THEM AS WINNING LOTTERY TICKETS AND START BELIEVING IN THE COMPANIES THAT ISSUED THEM. We have to BELIEVE in GameStop, AMC Theaters, BlackBerry, Bed Bath and Beyond, Nokia, etc. We have to start TRULY BELIEVING in these companies... we have to HOLD NO MATTER WHAT. 

Because if we don't, Wall St will have won another victory over the small guys.

tl;dr: hold these stocks like your future and all these other companies' futures depend on it - because they do. If we don't, I can guarantee all of us will be headed toward the very DARK future.",URGENT: Money isn't the only thing at stake anymore

I LOVE THE STOCK !! THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVISE !! 
I'm sorry,
But I don't want to be an emperor.
That's not my business.
I don't want to rule or conquer anyone.
I should like to help everyone - if possible -
Jew, Gentile - black man - white.
We all want to help one another.
Human beings are like that.
We want to live by each other's happiness - not by each other's misery.
We don't want to hate and despise one another.
In this world there is room for everyone.
And the good earth is rich
And can provide for everyone.
The way of life can be free and beautiful,
But we have lost the way.
Greed has poisoned men's souls,
Has barricaded the world with hate,
Has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed.
We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in.
Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want.
Our knowledge has made us cynical.
Our cleverness, hard and unkind.
We think too much and feel too little.
More than machinery we need humanity.
More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness.
Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost...
The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together.
The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men -
Cries out for universal brotherhood - for the unity of us all.
Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world -
Millions of despairing men, women, and little children -
Victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people.
To those who can hear me, I say - do not despair.
The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed -
The bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress.
The hate of men will pass, and dictators die,
And the power they took from the people will return to the people.
And so long as men die, liberty will never perish. ...
Soldiers!
Don't give yourselves to brutes -
Men who despise you - enslave you -
Who regiment your lives -
Tell you what to do - what to think and what to feel!
Who drill you - diet you - treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder.
Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men -
Machine men with machine minds and machine hearts!
You are not machines!
You are not cattle!
You are men!
You have the love of humanity in your hearts!
You don't hate!
Only the unloved hate -
The unloved and the unnatural!
Soldiers!
Don't fight for slavery!
Fight for liberty!
In the 17th Chapter of St Luke it is written: ""the Kingdom of God is within man"" -
Not one man nor a group of men, but in all men!
In you!
You, the people have the power -
The power to create machines.
The power to create happiness!
You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful,
To make this life a wonderful adventure.
Then - in the name of democracy -
Let us use that power -
Soldiers in the name of democracy
Let us all unite!
Let us fight for a new world -
A decent world that will give men a chance to work -
That will give youth a future and old age a security.
By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power.
But they lie!
They do not fulfil that promise.
They never will!
Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people!
Now let us fight to fulfil that promise!
Let us fight to free the world !

https://i.imgur.com/aprY1AB.png

Working backwards from the number of shares short, 61.78M as of Jan 15, that means there was a set of investors already long 61.78M and were lending out shares, and if the short sellers sold them to open, another set of 61.78M are being held somewhere else, i.e. at a minimum 123.56M shares could be long.

considering just last reported institutions + top holders, that's 104.19M shares, leaving at a maximum 19.4M shares owned by retail... If all of WSB just bought 5 shares that's already 37M shares... almost double of the remaining shares made available from shorts...

This assumes the amount of institutions that disallows lending shares is miniscule, and that none of these funds are selling off their shares to retail.","Another perspective on available shares, calculating from last reported shorts"

Behind open doors the hedgies are currently figuring out deals to unwind this mess. And are trying to get to every share shorted only one time.

`Original share -&gt; Shorted`

This will reduce reported short interest possibly to about 7%, but in the end they will need to buy the remaining shares back from retail.

In a situation like this I try to put myself in my counterpart’s shoes. So if I were a greedy, fraudulent bastard who would try to bankrupt a company for a few bucks and would rather risk crashing the market than take a loss, how would I deal with a hungry pack of 🦍 🦍 🦍 beating down my door for my lunch money? Well, we’ve seen them try a number of dirty tactics to try and scare us into selling. Short ladders, lying in the media that they closed their position, restricting free trading of a stock, and more. But all of these moves had one thing in common, and failed for the same reason: it showed us that they are DESPERATE for us to SELL, only confirming to us that they do in fact still hold a huge short position. 

So then what could they do to convince us that it’s over and the short squeeze won’t ever squoze? The answer is simple: nothing. Stop driving the price down, stop the FUD campaigns, just do... nothing. Let us sweat it out and speculate while the paper handed start to fold and trigger a selloff.

la67ay,KingPhoenixDragon,2021-02-01 15:50:14,GME,"Over the course of the weekend when folks were politely asked to relax and enjoy the weekend, nearly every sub involved in GME, AMC, BBBY, BB &amp; NOK in some capacity has been invaded by Wall Street &amp; Robinhood executives spreading misinformation, pushing cryptocurrency or silver. If you believe in the stocks you choose then believe in them wholeheartedly but don't push them on others. There's a diseased rat known as Wall Street infiltrating Reddit forums who's agenda is to turn the tide back to corporate greed. Many of us here either grew up with GameStop or have kids that grew up with GameStop, I myself am a combination of both. Many of us here have been victims of corporate greed and a destroyed economy that destroyed our lives, I can testify to that IRL. 

Everytime working class citizens try to break economic barriers there's new rules created and enforced by the corporations. They create social divide and diversionary tactics to divert attention away from the real problem. At the age of 39 I've only recently gotten involved in investing in stocks and not because of r/wallstreetbets. A former supervisor told me about Robinhood but I didn't join until after I was laid off. The point is we're from different backgrounds but we share a common goal of making extra cash. We also share a common enemy/enemies. 

Be careful who you get advice from. The rats are in the building spreading disease. Together we're strong. That doesn't mean we're always right. Many long-time investors here will tell you the GME, AMC runs carry risk, but that goes for the stock market as a whole. There's no such thing as a sure thing, it's literally a gamble. Be smart about who you listen to. I have money tied in AMC and I myself plan on holding but not because of what someone else said. I missed my chances at GME even as it took a decline. My financial obligations take priority. Think before you invest, be it sticking it to the 1%, diversifying your portfolio, earning money or just your pure love of the company and it's stock.

POWER TO THE PLAYERS GME AMC HOLD! 💎🙌🏽💎

And half of these clowns calling people a boomer are boomers themselves. Don't forget where that term originally came from.

I bought an extra share at open and A STOP LOSS WAS SET. not only that but I COULDNT SET NO STOP LOSS AS THE WEBSITE SHOWS! (refer to images 1 and 3).

la7i2w,Anwbrw19,2021-02-01 16:41:55,GME,"You must hold.

Buy the red, and HOLD.

By buying more shares, that’s one less share on the market, increasing DEMAND.

By HOLDING, not only are you keeping the demand, but demand + holding is the perfect synergy to INCREASE THE STOCK PRICE.

The squeeze hasn’t happened yet, and won’t happen if you panic. Read below...

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

If you are new, pay attention;

Do not fear. If you’re seeing red, you haven’t lost money, not until you have sold. The price is being forced down TO SCARE us into giving up our shares.

WHY? Because selling your share decreases demand, decreases the price, and gives the shorters (Citadel, etc) a better rate to cover their debts.

So what would I do? HOLD. As long as I’m holding, I’m not losing money. Even better, I’m buying the RED, so buying more shares, lowering my average, and increasing demand thus price.

laacwm,j901719,2021-02-01 18:34:31,GME,"Dear Virgins
The price you see on your screen is the price at which the stock traded last. This means if I was an actually mentally challenged individual and would decide to buy GME at $1000, despite the rest of the market trading at at 325, the price would be $1000 after my purchase.

What's happening now, is that $1000 purchase I made? It is immediately overwritten by hedgefunds who buy and sell stock to themselves, at a price-range that will make people think there is a sell-off. Literally playing you psychologically into FOMOing your gainz away. In other words, their strategy fails if we BUY on the dip that they manipulate the price to.

GME is held to stay at 250 dollar-ish
BB &amp; NOK, were NOKked down to Friday levels (4.5-4.9 range is fixed for NOK, 14-15 range for BB)
AMC - HEAVY manipulation for the 14.5 price

So, what do you do about this? You hold. Why? Cause they have to maintain their short position by paying regular premiums. Next time they have to report on these payments is February 9th.

Not a SJW, so don't give a shit if you believe me or not. Want proof? Go look for it yourself instead of basing your investment decisions on an internet forum full of degenerates. Nobody here is a financial advisor, stop looking for one.",Dear Virgins

lab5z4,roy69al,2021-02-01 19:06:20,GME,"Alright everybody - as a retarded monkey I will try to make this short and strategic. Get my VISION!

This is OUR current trajectory: the army keep buying and holding - Wallstreet is not only fixing the counterfeit stocks but at the same time CLOSING the short positions slowly. They keep prices from going to high thus keeping their losses to a minimum. In a week or so this will be fixed. Prices will decline and most of us will be holding STOCKS WE LOVE. 

Then - class action against RH, Citadel, the clearinghouses heck we will probably try and sue the SEC for blatant disregard of the law. And to WIN these need to be organized and well orchestrated steps in order to even get traction. But we ARE DECENTALIZED and INDEPENDENT RETAIL MONKEYS.

Spoiler alert: These cases will drag out for years - everyone holding stock at XYZ date will be able to participate and there might be a settlement. Guess what wont happen - nobody is going to jail. They will have covered their trails, paid lawmakers and judges just to keep doing business as usual being more careful not to get caught by the public with their pants down AGAIN.

THIS IS HOW WE WIN:

This Wednesday we make a stand - everyone in retail and I mean everyone puts in a sell order for $4269 or something like ""similar to"" that. THIS IS THE MOON. HEAR ME OUT - THIS OUR SETTLEMENT - ON OUR TERMS. 

WHAT THIS MEANS FOR US:

Everyone of us wins and wins big - if you came in to help retail last week at $550 you x8 your money. Most support at $250-$350 will 12x their money. The majority of the army at around $50 will 90x their money and beyond that your going to Pluto anyway my friend. 

Now we have more MONEY which means more POWER not on just on Wall Street but in real life this buying power means something but only now - not if the stock drops to $50 - and we WON the negotiations at the table. Wall Street will not change the way we think but they will be SCARED and SCARED for GOOD. 

Their losses will be huge and only if we end up TAKING the CASH will it be PAIN. They might need a bailout and if the market can't support it - they will ask UNCLE SAM, after all ""they are to big to fail"". This would be the FIRST BAIL OUT not for banks or insurance companies but to SETTLE WITH US. 

WHY THEY WILL TAKE IT:

Right now they don't even have an OUT. They had to close all trading to stop an infinity squeeze and at this point none related parties are trying to make the system not collapse. Prices will go to infinity if we hold to infinity. THIS WONT HAPPEN. WHAT WILL HAPPEN is taking our settlement: MAKES THIS ""GO AWAY"" with so much pain but the pain outweighs the risk - the risk of someone going to jail or a whistleblower outing the illegal activity undoubtedly. 

And THIS IS WHY WE BEAT - OUTSTRATEGIZED THEM. THEY ARE A MACHINE AND WE KNOW HOW IT WORKS - PAIN AND LOSSES outweigh INFINITY RISK that includes ""who knows what the fuck will happen"" and they will take the loss and the pain. 

Taking their money now - is the most PAIN we can give them - they will loose BILLIONS AGAIN - they change their ways because they can't risk this same scenario again. 

THIS WOULD BE REAL CHANGE - THEY WILL BE SCARED OF US - WE WILL HAVE MORE STRENGHT - MORE BUYING POWER and LEVERAGE BECAUSE WE WON AT THE NEGOTIATING TABLE ON OUR TERMS:

PAY US fair market VALUE for this situation: EVERYBODY IN RETAIL WON THIS BET. GAMESTOP WILL NOT BE BANKRUPTED - IT WILL SURVIVE - WE MADE OUR STAND - WON BIG and KEEP ON POLICING WITH OUR NEW WEALTH. 

PLEASE DONT DELETE THIS - WE NEED TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION AND I HOPE a FEW MONKEYs with degrees can support me here and make more sophisticated comments to support this strategy and then lets get all our Monkeys on board. If its $4269 I think we all WIN or pick a percentage. THIS IS THE MOON. THESE ARE OUR STARS and LETS KEEP THE ROCKET FLYING. CASH IS ROCKETFUEL and WE ARE TAKING OUR FUEL from Melvin and Citadel. 

THEY ARE MAKING MOVES

THIS IS OUR FINAL MOVE - they don't buy we end up in the same position anyway - if they don't take it at the negotiating table we sue them etc. etc. but AT LEAST we tried to settle and not at infinity, not at PLUTO for all of us (if you invested pre-$50 your leaving the Milky Way on a spaceship made of Tendies) but the MOON like we said - we are NOT GREEDY. WE DONT WANT INIFINITY - THE MOON THOUGH - WITH THEIR MONEY - REAL MONEY not digits that they manipulate. 

THEY ARE SCARED OF THIS TACTIC - WE DO THIS - THEY DONT TAKE IT - WE HAVE A PRECIDENT FOR COURT. 

THEY WILL TAKE IT - TRUST ME - IN THE END THIS IS A MACHINE - THE MACHINE HAS TO ELIMINATE RISK - the option right now is INFITY BUST (unacceptable) or do everything illegal to safe your ass (of course they do this) - WE NEED TO CHANGE OUR POSITION TO: 

WE WON THE BET - PAY UP and STOP EVERYTHING ELSE. IT WILL MAKE EVERYTHING GO AWAY and we will have MORE POWER AND UNLIMITED TENDIES!!!!!!!!!!!!","his is how we WIN. WE MAKE A STAND !!!! HEAR ME OUT - THERE HAS TO BE AN ""OFFER"". We make a stand together BEYOND HOLDING! WHILE WE ARE BUYING AND HOLDING THEY ARE ILLEGALLY FIXING THS SYSTEM.

So I’ve read that S3 shortsighted and Ortex a reporting that there around 55% short positions still active.

That’s decrease of about %70 from last weeks numbers.

How could they have done this without buying back their borrowed shares and driving up the price? I can only assume that they exited pre-market when the price rose to $550 and somehow made an agreement for the long whales to not buy into it, or sell their shares.

I hate to sound conspiracy, but the only way I can see this happening is if the borrowed shares never existed in the first place and they’ve essentially been let off the hook.

Is there anywhere other than WSB to discuss what’s happening with this stock? I see a lot of HOLD, but not very much analysis or explanation of how there’s only 50% short positions left..",How have a huge percentage of short positions been closed without driving up the price?

lac9ru,Anwbrw19,2021-02-01 19:50:56,GME,"EXPLANATION FOR WORRIED NEWBIE TRADERS 👇🏻

”The volume is low”.

What does this mean? The total volume of shares being moved around is LOW. The dips you are seeing are artificial and are NOT due to people selling shares. It’s illegal market manipulation at its finest.

Hedge funders sell their shares to each other at lower and lower bids (by tiny amounts) in rapid succession using bots. This tricks the algorithm into thinking a shit ton of shares are being dumped = the price is shown to go down.

In reality, no one is selling. Hedge funders are just moving shares between each other. If people were actually selling, you’d need at least 10x the volume to bring the price down like that.

So, stop panicking pussies. They’ve been doing this all week. Stop staring at your screen and watching every dollar movement. Go for a walk without a phone, have a shower, damn have breakfast if you haven’t already. Share this info to other newbie traders",Yes!!!! Read!‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️

If that one person (who’s not part of the 9,999) goes and sells their one share of GME, and there’s only one offer to buy that share, and the offer is $5 per share, then GME is currently trading at $5.

In this way, low volume of trades (in this example, one share being sold one time) doesn’t reflect the real demand for GME, but instead, reflects that one sale — because what *really* reflects the real demand for GME is the 9,999 of us that aren’t selling.

TL:DR prices based on low volume numbers don’t reflect demand

THEH HALT TRADING ON APPS  THEN AN HOUR BEFORE THE MARKET THEY SHORT ATTACK a sneaky pathetic childish attempt that slightly worked in there favour but didn't suffice as we kept our hands strong.

We then move to the weekend, they've had time to think and time to regroup realising these petty tactics aren't working and they need something new, by know we know bots have infiltrated this group and you could be one possible reading this post and if you are SUCK YA NAN hence forth onto my conclusion...

I think this closing value is their last tactic they can pull before the rocket launches, call.me crazy if you think I'm wrong but I personally think they have short attacked today with the means of not actually buying any of the stock back so the price of the stock stays low meaning when the market reopens statistically people will sell as they won't want too much of a loss and the longer the price stays low the liklihood of a paper hand folding gets bigger .... which makes me believe this is their last option hold off from buying as long as they can to cause a panic amongst the community of 💎👐

The media is intentionally leaving out all the positive transformation information that is going on inside Game Stop.  What am I talking about you might ask.  Let me ask everyone this:  If there was a company that was experiencing 300% yoy ecommerce growth, closing unprofitable stores, heading into a 200 billion TAM computer gaming industry and oh yeah, three new board members including Ryan Cohen.  

I know  everyone is looking for the big squeeze and you fucking retarded apes have done fantastic holding the line, however, there is a great long term story about to unfold here.  The current tradeable float is probably less than 10 million shares, more than likely closer to 5 million.  The institutions own over 100% and the current BUY AND HOLD strategy is working like a charm.  The hedge funds, market makers and brokerages have engaged in criminal activity to hold the stock down.  My point is, the company and Cohen hasn't said a word due to earnings coming up 3/25/21.  Just think what the stock might do if/when CEO Sherman steps aside and they announce Cohen as CEO.  Then Cohen announces his plan of how he's going to transform the company.  This is why I haven't sold along with the fact that I'm just a retarded ape like everyone else, but I really just like the stock.

I see Melvin seems to be the only hedge fund openly shorting the stock. Obviously there must be others weather through them along with smaller traders. I see these people are losing money as others are gaining hedge funds and simple traders. I guess I’m wondering will the average trader benefit more than larger firms when all is done? I would assume the stock will eventually tank due to its over evaluation or a complete decline in the market. Who’s gonna end up holding the biggest empty bag. Additionally what does this do to gamestop if their p&amp;l doesn’t change much. I loved going their younger and getting a game from their vast shelves and the midnight releases. I feel now less people go in to just see what they have. Less people doing trade in. More people buy from online and go to major retailers. The Knick Mack business is done at better stores and online. The stock will tank. Who’s screwed??,Who are the winners and losers in the future

 **You are nothing more than the product.**
