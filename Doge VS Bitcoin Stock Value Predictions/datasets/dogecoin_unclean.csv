I apologize in advance if the questions don't make sense.

**What they basically said was:**

How do we believe that crypto like Bitcoin really uses the blockchain technology and that maybe some foreign entity actually does have the full control of \[insert cryptocurrency\] and the entire peer to peer network checks to make sure the blockchain isn't tampered with thing is a lie?  


They also just have an overall distrust of it and believe that's its a ploy for the people on top to make money or a plot for foreign governments to undermine our current systems in place to 'screw us over'.  ('We' being western countries) They don't believe that no one has central control over it in some way.

The results made history and changed the world forever; they positively benefited everybody in ways nobody could imagine, until they existed. Only by random, unexpected outcome did these discoveries come to existence. Dogecoin falls into this category which is why I believe it will become much bigger than many, including the ‚Äúexperts‚Äù, can fathom. How can one be an expert on something that‚Äôs never existed?

n53lyz,m0bius_stripper,2021-05-05 01:12:43,dogecoin,"Hi dogecoin community!

I spent a lot of time in these parts on a different account wayy back in the day (the ~2014 era). I remember when the 1 DOGE = 1 DOGE memes began, when the tipbot was everywhere, and when the faucets flowed freely. I still have my wallet, and it has a non-trivial amount of doge that I'd love to be able to play around with again.

However, my DogecoinQt client is 7 years behind the history and MultiDoge refuses to sync within a reasonable amount of time, too. In my desperation to access my doges, I turned to coinb.in and hand-crafted some transactions to try things out and see if I could transfer my coins into a modern wallet or an exchange. I think I set too low of a fee when doing so, and now they seem to be stuck in limbo forever. I tried the ol' ""child pays for parent"" pattern that I found works for Bitcoin (where your next tx has a really high fee that depends on the previous tx going through, so miners accept both), but that too led to nothing. 

Here are the transactions: [initial transfer to another wallet](https://chain.so/tx/DOGE/24f8c64532afc0e5d1055449502de8cbb6af654e298388e9d419fb653b8eb932), [""child pays"" attempt](https://chain.so/tx/DOGE/be02c02b0c827ee63c251aeb3c03555b331fda263b78d1655e0e2153b014a290), and the [final try](https://chain.so/tx/DOGE/4c71129f0db229dd444aaf253ed8e1fb60f79d8122732ff8e1bf3c1256d05ab0) to let an absurdly-high fee push my tx chain through. 

Is there any hope? Should I just try to wait it out? What are my options here?",Help an old shibe recover a few crumbs from an ancient wallet

n5403t,Ambitious-Hero,2021-05-05 01:32:58,dogecoin,"So in excitement of the current situation I wanted to hop on DOGE fast before it starts rising as it does now. So I started the fiat transfer at a point when Doge price was at $0.32. What I mean by fiat transfer is a long process of buying DOGE that I didn‚Äôt expect it to be but it was the only way to save on high fees. The story goes like this: I‚Äôm in Europe, Czechia and here I found the best Exchange to use is Kraken. But since Kraken accepts only EUR and here the currency is CZK, I went to local exchange first to get EUR which I then put on my EUR bank account provided by local bank and successfully sent the money to the Kraken bank account. Unfortunately there wansn‚Äôt any way of instant payment but I was told Kraken will receive my money the other day. I did a payment to Kraken using the same Kraken bank acc a few days ago with a few euros to test the speed and to be sure that the bank account I will be using for this big payment is right and fast. It was. My ‚Ç¨10 test that I did a few days ago was transferred fast and Kraken had it the other day. But this time it was different. I sent way more ‚Ç¨ using the same account and waiting till the other day to hapily see the funds on Kraken and buy Doge coin. Unfortunately I waited the whole day and nothing. In the meantime doge went to 0.50 which is driving me nuts thinking that I already could have had double the whole investment. Currently not only I won‚Äôt get the amount of Doge for the money I put in as I was expecting but I also lost the opportunity to already earn with the current big Doge wave. Fortunately I believe in DOGE üêï but I would really like to find a fast and low fees way to buy Doge in Europe. After this experience I really don‚Äôt want to use my local bank to send funds to Kraken again. Do you have any advice on the best &amp; fastest method to buy Doge with? PLEASE, let me know :) ‚Ä¶ DOGE TO THE MOON! üòé",How I lost half of my DOGE investment

Sure, I pay the Bitcoin fee to transfer, but I‚Äôd rather pay a fraction than be on a STOCK trading app like RH that fails every time there‚Äôs a bullrun.

If you really believe in cryptocurrency, start getting in the weeds of how crypto is sent, how wallets work, and securing your account with things like 2FA or a physical offline wallet for max security.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but there are 10k coins mined every minute, right? And at this point in time, according to the coinmarketcap site, it is third for ""most circulating supply"" of all the cryptos. 

There are about 130 Billion coins circulating and only 8 billion humans on earth. Averaging that out, we could all equally have about 16,250 doge coins! I personally have about half of that at the moment, but I couldn't imagine forcing myself to own more than that. 

Don't you think there is enough doge in the wild to consider adding a cap to the coin, or at the very least, make the supply growth slower? Could this restricted supply make the coin that much more valuable? I understand that a 4% yearly inflation rate really isn't that bad, but hopefully slowing that down could make the coin jump in price.

n549tx,Beercyclerun,2021-05-05 01:46:53,dogecoin,"I'm curious about the logistics of accepting doge as a currency in daily transactions. I am in a hip tech savvy area and I am envisioning a kid vegetable stand that accepts cryptocurrency, specifically dogecoin. It's more of a fun activity for my kids that have grown a very large garden with a huge surplus of vegetables.


We typically sell tomatoes and cucumbers and squash for about $0.10 a piece. Think I would like the cute neighborhood lemonade stand. We're not making big money but the kids enjoy it and it teaches them money skills and helps improve social communication.

Difficulty: I really love the one doge equals one doge line. As a long time holder since 2014, I think my diamond hands have been pretty dope. 


Imagine a veggie stand

 üçÖ üçÖüçÖ = 1 Doge. 

üßÑ = 1 Doge.

2 squash = 1 Doge


You get the idea. Logistics, since I'm dealing with kids 8 and under, I do not want them dealing with electronics/wallets. Is it possible to print out a static QR code for others to scan and send payment?

 Even though I have invested in this for a long time, I'm still pretty smooth brain about the security elements. I clearly would not use my wallet that has the big bucks... I would have an empty wallet an address just for these small payments. Is it possible to use a static QR code that is your address, or is that a security risk? 


I hear a lot of chatter on here about changing wallet address after a payment is received. 

The whole point of vegetable stand is to get rid of extra vegetables and have the kids make a dollar or two, split three ways ü§£ honestly if I get more than two doge exchanges over the course of a month I would be surprised. I just think it'd be a cute novelty and bring in a couple people who would like the idea of in-person exchange of crypto for goods",Real talk - accepting as a currency

I bought in around .15 and kept purchasing to an average of .32. My question is this: 

Is it detrimental to the Doge cause to sell high then take that money and buy low to accumulate more coins?

I see a lot of people getting grief for being a ""paper hands"" is that what that means? People who sell and buy causing the fluctuations? 

I won't do it if it means hurting our chances at pushing Doge to the $1 mark. I'm in it for the moons of Jupiter to be sure.

I get that this may sound cheesy, but it's my personal belief that people who use Dogecoin for fun will always get more enjoyment out of it than those who merely see it as a good investment. I'm glad to have gotten in before Saturday, but I just wanted to remind the vast majority of people here that dogecoin is a great community because it's a light-hearted way to exchange currency for fun, not a money-grabbing stock opportunity as some may doubtlessly see it.

Just have fun. Invest what you plan to share with others and don't pour in money that you're hoping will make you rich or something. This way, you'll be content no matter what happens.

P.S.

If you're looking to get Dogecoin Core (which is the fully operational wallet) and not wait a week or two to sync, you can follow the instructions in the excellent post linked below to download a torrent file with about 90% of the synchronization. They recommended BitTorrent, but I found qBittorrent to work just fine (BitTorrent tries to get you to download other software such as Opera and McAfee during installation). Using a torrent file makes things about 10x faster, but be warned that **you should absolutely never download a torrent file unless you are 100% certain it is safe**. There should be plenty of good comments (no bots) and upvotes recommending that the file has been tested and approved.

I'm not sure if this is even legal to ask since I'm not from US and didn't really care that much about SNL show before other than what was already presented online.

Since we all wait to what happens on 8th of May (personally, I would like to see if anything happens because that would surely determine the following rates of our beloved currency) I have one simple question and bear in mind - if it's illegal to give answer, just let me know that it's stupid to ask and care no more: 

Is there any site I could watch SNL online streaming live from Europe?

I was 60k in the hole, and fighting with everything I had to get even.  Even though I knew I couldn't afford to invest when I didn't pay my bills, I dropped $200 on doge.  


I continued to work hard and pay my bills, choosing second hand clothing and paying more to my debt over having ""nice"" things.  I continued to get closer.  I was so close I could feel it, just a few thousand left to go.  And today, my Doges were worth more than my debt.   


I just wanted to say thank you so much.  my ACH will clean in 3 days, and from it I'll pay off the last of my collections.  Doge saved me.   


It's still heading up.  I imagine we'll be at $1 way sooner than anyone was expecting.  I've still got a little skin in the game (although not much)  Thank you shibes for showing me the way, and helping me get up to 0.  I really REALLY appreciate it.

Anyways, I'm a game developer who's just about done with his masters program, and I've been putting a lot of thought into this whole Doge movement and decided that if Dogecoin reaches 5$, I will dedicate all of my time and energy into creating a high fidelity Doge Game. 

If you can think it up and it's doge-worthy, I will make it. Infinite run pixel Nyan-Doge? Done. 3Doge simulator? Done. 2-D-Moon: Doge the Musk? Done. No matter how long it takes me, I will pour my blood sweat and tears into the art, programming, developing, etc. to make it amazing. Game development is my passion, so I'm ready to make this a part of that passion as well.

Now, I'm not saying 5$ is when everyone should sell; it's just the benchmark for the Unofficial-Official Doge Game. On the contrary, I want 5$ to be **the new low**.

Any crypto‚Äôs advantage over fiat money comes from decentralization, not from having a finite limit. What eliminates reckless inflation is the inability of any government to create currency out of nowhere. No entity will ever create either Bitcoin or Dogecoin at will, regardless of having a theoretical limit. 

Also, a limited amount of Bitcoin will only encourage hoarding and eventually won‚Äôt offer any mining rewards and therefore there won‚Äôt be an incentive for verifying the transaction ledger. This defeats the whole purpose of crypto security. 

On the other hand, the slow increase of total Dogecoins will encourage spending and mining for new coins with continuous ledger verification. Moreover, a growing economy needs to increase the amount of currency as new goods, services, and people are introduced into the market. Otherwise distributing a limited amount over more goods and people causes deflation of not only goods but also salaries, encouraging even more hoarding and disincentivizing work. Think about it, how are you going to maintain a minimum wage as the population increases? 

All this without mentioning Dogecoin transactions are faster, easier for businesses to accept, 95% of it is not held by the top 2% like Bitcoin, and the ever-increasing number of lost keys won‚Äôt guaranty the eventual loss of the entire currency, like 20% of Bitcoin and counting.

n55i0k,MBCnerdcore,2021-05-05 02:51:22,dogecoin,"**Dogecoin by design, is positioned as a blockchain version of a fiat currency.  What does that mean?**
________________________________________
Fiat currencies typically do not have intrinsic or use value. 

They have value firstly **through government regulation**.  Since this is a decentralized cryptocurrency, we can replace *""the government""* with *""the underlying tech/algorithms, being updated by developers with 'Litecoin' as a starting line, and 'a great fiat cryptocurrency with secure and fast transactions' as a finish line""*. 

**The only other way that fiat currencies have value, is because parties engaging in exchange agree on its value.**  AKA 1 DOGE = 1 DOGE.  AKA how your local country's CountryBucks works.

Right now the disadvantages to these, the ""problems"" are:

**1) Slow Development** This is currently and ACTIVELY being addressed by the fine folks over at /r/dogecoindev, the Doge development Twitter/Discord, and the Doge GitHub.  The devs are working on implimenting new features to catch Doge up with other mainstream crypto, and if you are a talented dev that wants to help, it's an open-source project and they would love you to lend a hand.

**2) Reputation as a Joke/Meme.**  I'll get to this later, but the TL;DR is that this reputation would be a disadvantage to ""investment"" type coins like Bitcoin but can actually be an advantage to a fiat currency because it creates demand and adoption. 

**3) Dogecoin's lack of ""usefulness"" compared to other crypto.**   ""Usefulness"" is subjective and really depends on the goals of the coin and its dev team.  The bottom line is that, **if Doge is succeeding at its own goals, then it's useful**.  Don't let people move the goalposts for you, each coin is focused on something different, and very few cryptocoins have 'actually using it as an inflationary fiat currency alternative' as a goal, which puts Doge up in the market leaderboard in this regard.
____________________________________
OK I said a magic word:   **Inflationary.**      And I kind of misrepresented DOGE.  DOGE is inflationary in the short term, and deflationary in the long term.

**Inflation is a market force that encourages spending**, rather than 'investing' (AKA hoarding AKA HODL).  The goal of Dogecoin isn't to sell it to get back into Local CountryBucks, **the goal is to spend them directly** on goods and services **as a currency** to avoid being locked into your CountryBucks at the whims of your governments.

All the people talking about ""*Doge can't be $10 because the market cap would be X*"" are actually arguing a strawman fallacy:  Doge as a CURRENCY shouldn't be compared to ""market cap"" like a STOCK.

**For instance:** What's the ""Market cap"" of the Canadian Dollar? Is it higher than Tesla? The GDP of Canada? The GDP of France? Apple shares? The answer is ""Who cares, that's not how regular people measure the value of the Canadian Dollar.""

The only thing that matters, just like with CountryBucks, is 'how much does an ape need to pay for a banana?""

**At an inflation rate of ~4% and shrinking, the supply matters less and less the farther in the future you look.**  There will be Billions and Trillions of Dogecoins out in the world, but that doesn't change the value of DOGE.  Just like with CountryBucks, the side-effect of printing a lot of coins is inflation.  Inflation is actually good for CountryBucks, because it encourages trade.  Money moving around is what gives currency value.

Just like with fiat CountryBucks, more can be printed all the time, but unlike with CountryBucks, Doge inflation is predictable and stable.  The inflation rate of DOGE is pre-calculated into the algorithm. It will never be higher inflation than it is right now. It will take 25 years for the current amount of coins to double.  **People saying Doge has ""infinite"" supply, must be planning on living forever.**  On a realworld practical level, it doesn't make a difference.
__________________________________
Doge is given value not from the flashy underlying tech or the scarcity of coins, but by **retailers accepting Doge as currency**. The more doge is adopted, the more stable the price. When some small companies started accepting Doge, the value went up.  When Crunchyroll, porn sites, and Newegg started accepting Doge, the value goes up even more.  When the biggest retailers (Walmart, Amazon, Netflix, etc) take the leap into accepting it, then suddenly the coin's value will go to the MOON.  And then it will stabilize at some value, and hover there ""un-Tethered"" to any nation's CountryBucks. 

**You can't ""pump and dump"" the EURO.** So that's why adoption is the goal, and DOGE isn't an ""investment"", it's a currency. The goal being - the more adoption, the more stable the value of the coin.  

**""Investing"" in DOGE is as silly as ""investing"" in EURO or Canadian Dollars.**  ^(Unless you know what you are doing -&gt;  See:  Forex trading) 
 The point is to spend them, not to hold them for X years and then sell them just to get back into CountryBucks.  ""Easy to spend at a wide variety of retailers"" is what will make DOGE useful.  Not to support DeFi or smart contracts, not to create NFTs or blockchain videogames, other coins will always be more useful for those things.  So yes, Doge isn't ""useful"" the way something like ETH or BTC is.  But those coins aren't as ""useful"" as an easy, cheap way to spend on goods and services.  
______________________________________________
And **yes, Doge is a meme joke coin.**  But the more people spread it and talk about it, the more valuable it is.  Eventually it becomes Kleenex or Band-Aid but without the IP and copyright problems - **people will be so used to it that the name is synonymous with 'cheap cryptocoin used for online shopping'**.  And in that regard, being a meme is a strength rather than a weakness.  This is the reason VHS beat Betamax, despite the tech disadvantage.  This is the reason Blu-Ray beat HD-DVD.  It's the reason the Nintendo DS beat the Sony PSP.  Sometimes the marketing, the brand name, a few high-profile supporters, is what it takes to be that household name, even against more powerful or useful tech.  In terms of mainstream branding, Dogecoin is probably only second to Bitcoin itself.  This is EXTREMELY powerful and useful, from a certain point of view.
_________________________________
So this is exactly the argument for Doge.  To be used as a fiat currency as an alternative to country-based fiat.  Yes it has downsides and the coin isn't perfect, and the devs have a lot of work to do, but **the constant FUD about Doge having ""infinite"" supply and therefore no value is missing the point**:   Doge and crypto like it should be compared to currencies, not stocks in the stock market and ""market cap"" of Apple or Tesla or the GDP of France.  **The success of Doge is measured by adoption**, not Doge's value to sell off for $CountryBucks.

I hope this clears up some of the 'talking past each other' arguments between shibes and those who can't wrap their heads around 'our goals are different, market cap doesn't matter'.","Dogecoin is a fiat currency, not an 'investment'. I am eager to see how valuable they turn out to be!"

I have 1000 doge coin right now and I‚Äôm not sure if I should put more in or or if I‚Äôm good with just that I bought them at different prices I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs a bad thing or if that really matters? I‚Äôm sorry for sound a dumb but I figured to buy some because you never know what could happen,Unsure
n55ldy,Dull_Jackfruit7306,2021-05-05 02:56:25,dogecoin,"Doge is a community and is the people's coin.  I thought keeping my average cost per coin down was the way when I first started buying Doge. But then I realized there are many others just starting their journey too with Doge and bought much higher than me.  We are supposed to DoOnlyGoodEveryday and that means to help others in our community prosper too.  So after you make back the money on Doge you put in, you dont just HoDL and never buy again, but Buy and HoDL to help the whole community grow helping others!!!  
So now I buy and raise my average cost.  I guess my point is dont be selfish.  If I was selfish and just cared about  keeping my average cost per coin down  I wouldn't of raised my average cost for you.  Let's Go!!!!üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§üëçüëç",Think Beyond Average Cost per Coin Shibes!!

Pretty interesting, at the very least. Some of it goes over my head, but I did enjoy their final remarks re: DOGE: 

&gt;*Aristotle said, ‚Äúthe gods too are fond of a joke,‚Äù and it‚Äôs clear the cryptocurrency gods continue to favor Dogecoin. DOGE is likely to live on as long as Bitcoin lives, and as long as jokes are funny. It is perhaps the purest ‚Äúgallows humor‚Äù investment vehicle ever created, mocking a frothy market with its playful indifference. In our view, current Dogecoin volatility is fueled by mania, but it is likely that Dogecoin will continue to be part of this cryptocurrency story over the long run, always in Bitcoin‚Äôs shadow, but always lurking and periodically outperforming to surprise us all.* ***DOGE has a long history of self-awareness and simplicity that makes it an attractive tool for expressing a wry cynicism about the state of the world. The coin offers a certain honesty that resonates in a complicated world and an often duplicitous cryptocurrency ecosystem. Most assets cannot rival that honesty, and Dogecoin‚Äôs longevity is ensured so long as one truism remains: people love a good joke.***","""World‚Äôs most comprehensive report on DOGE"" May 4 2021"

n563he,hyodirect,2021-05-05 03:23:04,dogecoin,"When you look at Elon Musk's projects, its clear that he is ambitious and set on revolutionising various aspects of society - conceptualised Hyperloop for fast transportation, space exploration as the ultimate form of life insurance, the $100m decarbonisation incentive, electric vehicles with self driving capability for low carbon emissions, Neuralink to cure illnesses. 

Elon is renowned for striving to make the seemingly impossible possible. He is obsessed with innovation, digital and change. From this, it is safe to assume that he is invested in crpyro because it resonates with him on a deeper level and not just to make money. 

I wager he wants to see the shift from centralised banks with a monopoly on currency to a world where crpytocurrency rules and everything therefore becomes more afforable and more people can get a slice of the pie - instead of it being taken by banks acting as an intermediary.

While it would seem hypocritical to some - a billionnaire wanting financial freedom for all - you have to remember that the projects he is involved in require capital. He us productively using his assets to enrich lives and he can't just solve financial inequality by giving billions away, it just doesn't work like that.

If he flies from one country to another country in a luxury private plane to work faster then he sure as hell deserves it, and more so than bankers who earns their fruits from the exploitation of people through their monopoly on currency.

Looking at news on Elon through the past week, it's mostly been negative in sentiment. Most likely his support for crypto continues to ruffle feathers. He is stepping on the toes of the friends of media moguls who have the power to decieve people into senselessly hating him.

So far followers of Elon are all up on Doge and Elon has promised his support (provided whales sell). I think he's genuine and driving for real and positive change. And don't trust the media about this being a bubble about to burst. This isn't Gamestop and this is unprecedented. Doge is going to revolutionise this space and is in line for mass adoption. People don't want to believe it but it is inevitable.",Dogecoin's unofficial CEO: Elon Musk deciphered

Think of Gas that you put in your car. So gas prices goes up when there is less/higher demand for it. So cryptocurrency is similar. The Dogecoin right now is worth like 50 cents. So if you bought 1 dollar you would have 2 Dogecoins (and you can convert the Dogecoin to regular money).

At this rate, the earliest point it can hit $1 is by the end of this month. So from then, it‚Äôll grow at faster rate. We can hit 3-7 dollars by 3-6 months. 


April 1st - $0.0575 beginning growth 
April 30th- $0.3929 end growth 
After drops and gains average month = $0.14 growth

Expected end of month for May = (+\-) $0.72-$0.79

This is based on the predicted drop to 0.556~ 
( where the drop can occurred and average out)

Give or take a gain by the end of the month averaging to 0.14 + 
=$0.696

Because I don't want to test it, I was wondering if anyone knew what would happen if you put in more than 100, and if it does limit you to 100, can you do multiple transactions in a row to withdraw it all (if you have it over 100 per se), or is there some time limit?

n56rao,ImperialDogeMaster,2021-05-05 03:59:22,dogecoin,"Instead of over-intellectualizing this idea, I‚Äôm just going to keep it simple. The 128 billion supply cap is irrelevant as a resistance to Doge reaching values over a measly dollar. 

The first step is to think of all the Dogecoins as one big pizza pie. This pizza is not exclusive to a particular customer (nation). Anyone can order this pizza from any place in the world (decentralized). But some might say that at 128 billion coins, this pizza is outrageously enormous. But no, it is not. If we breakdown this pizza by slices and a bunch of people from different countries just pay for each fraction of this pizza, then ordering this Doge pie is a piece of cake. 

In fact, at this moment, America alone approximately has 26.8 trillion dollars (fiat currency) in circulation. Considering this fact, you can easily form the logic that 128 billion coins is tiny compared to 26.8 trillion dollars. And obviously, since Doge is marketed worldwide to other rich nations that also have trillions in economy, it means that the potential of this glorious Doge pizza being entirely claimed and subsequently rising in value beyond a measly dollar is quite realistic, just as realistic as how the valuation of BTC have risen since its inception into the crypto infrastructure. 

Then when you think of the other factors that makes Doge different (special) from BTC, the appetite for this pizza becomes even more enticing. Technically speaking, Doge is:

* significantly faster in exchange times
* more economical with cheaper trading fees
* more accessible because of its massive supply
* already supported by an international network of businesses

And then, non-technically speaking, Doge has enormous clout because of its fine character. Doge is a global sensation for its complex humor (memes) and soul (Do Only Good Everyday). Although BTC gained worldwide acceptance due to its practical use in the modern digital age, it lacks genuine popularity with common people because its personality is stale. It has the appeal of a business-serious boss at your annual holiday function while Doge is that dude with the relatable jokes and stories that you conspire an after party with after the lame hours come to an end.

Now, what I love about this community is that it‚Äôs seemingly built around your average trader.  We‚Äôre all here to try and make this the next big crypto.  I‚Äôm not one to attempt to tell you what to do with your money, but if we all threw in $5-10 at each landmark/threshold, we can smother out the limit sellers, and get this thing soaring to the moon.

[ Source screenshot from Amarante - \\""Home\\"" - Music video with an animated Elon Musk Tesla Roadster with Starman. Youtube.com\/AmaranteMusic ](https://preview.redd.it/xmg748w298x61.jpg?width=1000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98c57fc742f84f09d56a218b4690a02cc0c6a437)

When Elon Musk tweeted on April 1, 2021, ""SpaceX is going to put a literal Dogecoin on the literal moon"", I think this has a correlation between SpaceX and his Starlink satellites.

Many thought this was a joke, but with SpaceX winning the $2.9 Billion Nasa contract to build the next moon lander for the Artemis program, this is becoming more of a reality to his tweet. Here is what I really think is going to happen.

When Nasa astronauts set foot on the moon again for the very first time since the end of the Apollo program in 1972 (Source: [Wikipedia.org](https://wikipedia.org/)), I think that one of the astronauts who will set foot on the moon during its' anticipated launch in 2024, will be the first Astronaut in space (on the literal moon in this case) to execute a DOGECOIN buy/sell transaction or a trade of the DOGECOIN cryptocurrency while on the Moon..

This will all be made possible with Elon Musk's Starlink satellites. Just like when Neil Armstrong made history with being the first human to set foot on the moon, one of the next astronauts sent up during the moon landing will make history with them being the first human in space to trade cryptocurrency (DOGE) on the moon. Why would this be important?

With the advancements of technologies, especially the technology that Elon Musk's companies are providing in offering expanded space exploration advancements such as SpaceX's Mission: Mars, planets other than Earth are going to need some form of currency options. This is where Cryptocurrencies come into play. Dogecoin is just the chosen one in this little big experiment for the Moon, but soon enough, cryptocurrencies of different forms will be the main currencies for our multi-planetary civilizations.

I guess only time will tell but until then, we can only speculate? What are you thoughts? May the 4th be with you.",My Elon Musk Dogecoin to the Moon theory with a Starlink and Mars Mission by SpaceX connection

I'm trying to determine how much I could potentially make if I hold or if I choose to trade (buy low and sell high)?

For example in a possible scenerio:

If I take profits at 7k when it's at 0.60, and then buy back when the value of doge is at 0.30 hypothetically. If it goes back up to 0.60, I can potentially make a net profit of roughly 14k.

If I hold and it goes back down to 0.30 and then back at 0.60, I would only have a net profit of 7k still.

Am I understanding this correctly? I don't think if I'm explaining this very clearly.

Listen alright, people that are just salty they missed out on getting in early like to criticise doge with the following information. 

They come out with questions like: 

What do you think about 46.99% of all doge being owned by 13 adresses and 67.23% being owned by 103 adresses? Do you honestly believe these people aren't going to dump on you?

But here's the thing right, these addresses would have dumped months ago, @5cents, 10cents, hell 20cents would be billions for some of those guys!!!! AND YET THEY ARE STILL HOLDING!

So I say to those critics this so bullish for us. 

Because those guys are either hodling well beyond where we are now, or that doge and those wallets have been lost years ago!!! 

Hold strong guys!! 

We are taking doge to the moon and beyond this is not a meme anymore. 

This is real. 

Doge is cheap to use, it's fast and it's secure. 

And Elon is going on SNL in a matter of days.

My experiences in doge coin have been rough. January of this year I told my parents I wanted to put $700 into doge coin (It was at .008 per coin at the time and I had some money from the summer job I had worked the previous year.) They flip flopped on the idea and ultimately chose to not let me, which obviously caused me to be disappointed but motivated me to look into more cryptocurrency and keep watching Doge. Then when it‚Äôs huge spike hit, I told my parent and then they said ‚Äúokay, now you can put your money in it‚Äù it was at .20 I believe at this time and I was in a bad mood because of the situation and had been trying to invest to save for a pilots license which has always been my dream. Today marking doges highest reached point, I have been forced to sell the doge coin I had in my brothers Robinhood account to him since it made his account ‚Äúto messy and hard to keep up with‚Äù. My dad let me setup an account and now Robinhood isn‚Äôt letting me transfer funds to it. I‚Äôm in the same place I was before and don‚Äôt know what to do. I can‚Äôt even manage my investments anymore and am ready to give up.

These are just 3 points, but the REAL POINT IS HODL! Don‚Äôt sell when Doge hits $1.00. Keep holding it. Keep buying it. If we make $1.00 the new floor, we are set to make our way to $2.00 USD and continue to grow from there.

I‚Äôm sure most of you are aware of the current situation involving GameStop. 

I was a doge HODLer of 500,000 from 0.004

Now here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing, and this is especially for those of you that wish you had more doge. 

I am moving 90% of my doge to GME in order to help push the mother of all short squeezes (MOASS) over the edge. 

I have spent countless hours since January reading DD throughout the many different subs that GME calls home. (Formally wsb, now r/GME and r/superstonk) as well as doing my own research quietly. 

My plan with this is to take part in a once in a life time opportunity to grab what is expected to be a heavy, heavy (very heavy) short term gain. 

Now I know that this won‚Äôt sit will with those who have sworn to HODL and uphold that HODLing, but that little extra push to GME could result in A LOT more doge buying and HODLing to help drive the demand of doge back up and reach your end goal even faster. 

This squeeze is going to happen regardless, I just thought more of you should be a part of it so afterwards we can get doge to where we really want it. 

Please take this kindly, as all shibes are, I know I will be back after the MOASS. I hope even a couple of others will be able to cash in on this to help doge. 

**this is not financial advice, and I am not telling you what to do.**

My concern with this question is that once it hits a dollar a massive amount of people will be satisfied with hitting it, and they'll sell all they have in it. As someone that's a bit new to crypto, what would something like that mean for the coin? I personally have my own diamond hands and wouldn't sell on the dollar, but I can't say it's not something I see on the horizon as something to worry about- with the way a fair amount of people in the community speak about it.

So doge hits one dollar several people have it set to sell at that point or around that point so on the same time it hits this miracle number the price also drops at rates that are insane because it is a currency that is valued by people continuing to buy in. On the same token after that very very big drop I‚Äôm expecting after 1 dollar or around there it now has enough attention yeah some people make good money but jot everyone because there wasn‚Äôt enough cash flow to go around so those who lost money not selling fast enough and those who continue to hold and continue to buy remain consistent and overtime the currency does rise and rise to levels people maybe never thought before.

Do not worry, to be honest, it's not much money, and I'm toying with the idea of bankruptcy anyway, so if this doesn't work, it's not like I'd really lose my money anyway.  Still, thinking about doing the same thing but split 4 ways into DOGE, BTC, ETH, and LTC.  So divide into 25%, and then split each into 25% drops as mentioned above.  Look, for example, say it was $10k.  You take $2.5k for DOGE, BTC, LTC, and ETH.  Then, you split the $2.5k into quarters, $625.  So that goes into each of them now, and then $625 in each after each 25% drop.",thinking about YOLOing into DOGE... in a smart way...

so I'm 40/f, not a lot of disposable income but I've been vaguely interested in crypto for 2 years or so, followed the game stop stuff of course but until last week I didn't have any kind of online stocks or crypto account at all. when I kept hearing about DOGE I think you guys were at about 10 cents so I knew I wasn't going to be a doge millionaire or some kind of legit ground floor person but for some reason I just really wanted to join up. and of course it took me a few days to set up an account and then it took a few more days to get the money into the wallet or whatever and anyway long story short is I am a casual redditor and a first-time crypto buyer so I think part of the spike now IN ADDITION TO the whales and celebrities just putting chunks in, there are people who also got interested in the last few weeks but didn't have any kind of crypto wallet so that growth is compounding as people get access to funds and potentially buy for the first time. on top of that of course there's people who already had some money in crypto or online stocks so I think this is going to ripple in a very positive way for at least a few more weeks. I only spent $200 but waiting on more funds so that won't be all....anyway I could be totally wrong about my theory that there are hundreds of thousands of people like me sort of hitting this crypto curiosity moment at the same time that Elon is going to be on and doge is rising...but I'm typically right about things.

First time poster, long time hodler. I think this coin has potential for one very big reason; Everyone, and I mean everyone, loves an underdog. Even the people that want to talk smack about it - marketcap this and increasing supply that....At the end of the day, everyone loves seeing the small guy rise to the occasion and blow the unsuspecting 'champions' out of the water.

I invested into Tesla early on, and my goodness, the amount of FUD and nonsense thrown around, it was the MOST shorted company ever for a while there. So many people thought the company could never make it, while more people realized the potential and were willing to put their money behind it, until one day, it was self-evident that it could. I think this day for Dogecoin is not far away.

With the recent rise(s), I've found myself instinctively thinking 'Is this the top?' and it takes me a minute to realize that there are so many, many people putting their faith(and dollars) into this at the current price. Then I read through twitter and reddit, and I see the true potential. There is no top. There is NO top.

For all the things that people consider to be the mark of a 'valuable' token, most crypto ""experts"" have it backwards ..If we have \_\_\_\_\_ + \_\_\_\_\_ = Adoption and then value...But mass adoption IS IT. If you have mass adoption, that's it, that's all you need. A currency is given value because people give it value. And Doge so far, in my eyes, is the best coin at getting new users into the space, hands down. And that in and of itself is invaluable to cryptocurrency in general. Everyone should be in support of this, the 'gateway' token.

So, here's to 8$ Doge(and beyond), when it surpasses BTC market cap, and I'll be back to shout 'You crazy son of a b\*tch, you did it'.",Doge is (literally) the underdog

n58dq6,swimming_up_current,2021-05-05 05:35:01,dogecoin,"**MINING**

Dogecoin like Litecoin is a copy of Bitcoin with a few changes added in. In Bitcoin a new block is mined roughly every 10 minutes and these blocks originally contained 50 bitcoins.

When Dogecoin was originally released it mined a new block every minute and the amount mined was random (within limits) and set by what block the chain was up to:

- Block 1 ‚Äî 100,000: 0-1,000,000 dogecoins

- Block 100,001 ‚Äî 200,000: 0-500,000 dogecoins

- Block 200,001 ‚Äî 300,000: 0-250,000 dogecoins

- Block 300,001 ‚Äî 400,000: 0-125,000 dogecoins

- Block 400,001 ‚Äî 500,000: 0-62,500 dogecoins

- Block 500,001 ‚Äî 600,000: 0-31,250 dogecoins

- Block 600,001+: 10,000 dogecoins

The other major change that Dogecoin has is that unlike Bitcoin which uses the SHA256 algorithm for mining, Dogecoin (like Litecoin) uses SCRYPT for it's mining algorithm. Originally this algorithm was designed to be ASIC resistant but ASIC's for SCRYPT have been around for years now.

**ECONOMICS**

So Dogecoin has an unlimited supply, or it's endlessly inflationary at a set and predictable rate of roughly 5.256 billion per year where the current total supply is 129 billion, so roughly 4% per year and declining each year.

**TRANSACTIONS**

Now for the interesting part, the fees. On paper Dogecoin has 10x the transactional capacity that Bitcoin has since it creates a 1mb block every minute instead of every 10 minutes. This supports roughly 33 transactions per second. When the network has more than 33 TPS miners will pick and choose to accept only the transactions with the highest fee. So priority transactions that need to be put into the next block have to pay a higher fee to do so. Due to the increased popularity of Dogecoin, fees have spiked up to $1.80 per transaction. And in sustained high network use they'll go even higher. This prices out low value transactions, micro transactions and severely limits the available use cases while limiting adoption. There are forks of BTC that solve this problem but I'm not here to shill them to you.",If Dogecoin is your first foray into cryptocurrency you might be interested in how it works and what makes it different to Bitcoin.

 To stop this,  I'm suggesting we add a new features to limit max supply to 50 billions and rest burn it by per transactions on the doge core networks. This burn will only run if the address/wallet got more than 50k coins burn rate per transactions 10% .. it will stop as soon 50billion max supply achieve. And also require to stop all blocks for mining. Once we achieve a limited number of max supply . We will have a new core function is that max wallet size is 100k and you can't buy or store more and send or receive transaction more than 100k. The reason is it will stop creating giants who try to control markets and we will have a equal opportunity and free market.

n594o2,myshortcomings,2021-05-05 06:20:30,dogecoin,"Originally the reason I didn‚Äôt like Doge, turns out to be the reason I think it‚Äôs the best.  With no hard cap to the amount of coins produced, the creator can balance the price down to a reasonable value. For instance if you were to go to buy a coffee with Bitcoin at the rate of $60K per coin, it would cost 0.000083 in Bitcoin. This math hurts my brain when thinking about using it as a currency. On the other hand if Doge was to settle somewhere at $1.00 per coin, 5 Doge for a cup of coffee is way easier to compute. I think it should never get to such a huge dollar amount per coin that you have to start paying past three decimal points for merchandise or services.  This will probably be the reason Bitcoin will fail over Doge.",Why I Believe Dogecoin Is Better Than Bitcoin

DOGE current circulating supply: \~130bn  
@ 5bn new coins /yr, the end of 2030 will have \~180bn coins in circulation.

now, for doge to hit $1 this year, the MARKET CAP will have to be equivalent in number to the circulated coin: 130 billion. very feasible. BUT, let's look at $100. Doge's market cap would have to be 100 times greater than the circulating supply. meaning \~$13 TRILLION. That's the current GDP of China, minus 1tr. So Unless Mao decides to sponsor $doge as their official currency or something, it's probably not gonna happen. and accounting for inflation won't change that fact.

Without wishing to whine, 2020 utterly obliterated my life - lost my business and health due to the pandemic and assorted lockdowns, lost a few friends from it along the way, have barely managed to keep hold of a tiny apartment, spiralled into debt and there really doesn't seem like much light on the horizon.  Sadly, my remaining 309 Doge isn't going to help much there, haha.

But watching all this has made me laugh like crazy for the first time in a long time.  Our little silly dog coin getting talked about by mainstream news.  Businesses starting to take payments in Doge.  My 80 year old mother asking me ""Have you heard about that doggy coin money on the internet?"" because she heard it on the radio.  Seeing people having their lives changed for the better because they suddenly have financial freedom for the first time ever.  Pets getting treatment.  Much wow.

It's beautiful, and it makes me smile.  You're all amazing for making this happen.  I may not have much of a stake, but I'm enjoying the ride more than you could possibly imagine, and if this is a world where Dogecoin can me worth nearly 70 cents, then maybe anything could happen and things will work out just fine.

This is exactly why you only need to invest money you don't need.
I needed the money I invested when I first bought at 34c after Doge Day. It dropped to 26c and I panicked. I sold. Then it went up to 28c and I thought ""I'm going to miss out"" and then it dropped to 13c (glad I was busy). I sold at 21c.
I lost 50% of my investment. If it was money I didn't need, I would have made twice that money by now, instead of losing half of it.

i think dogecoin is a more of a social movement with people working together to lift each other up as a collective. i bought in back  in feb 21 when i saw elons tweet about doge and i had this instinct just something that told me this is going to be big in future.

my gut feeling was that since this is a meme currency(that i seriously think is much more than just that now), i think many of us and all the experts out there are not able to fathom the power of memes in a world that is all messed up. it brings a smile to our faces when all is not well, it brings the people of all the different nationalities together even if its a short lived moment. it is a symbol of hope for us people who were forever doomed to never break above the cycle of living paycheck to paycheck. it is giving us the hope to dream that things might change for the better. it is a power of the common people to break the chains and be free!

* **Break free from your debts my good people!**
* **Break free from living paychechk to paycheck** (it has allowed us to dream that there can be a way)
* **Brings a smile to our faces (**we dont value this enough)
* it shows us in a way that only we (us the people) can bring and lift eachother up if we work and believe in something together.
* Believe in the power of memes!

I traded away my 50,000 dogecoins at $0.33 for what I think another great opportunity. But, of course this is after realizing when Dogecoin hit 0.07 earlier this year that it‚Äôs here to stay. 

And there seems to be a lot of support behind it. Behind a coin with no real use case or solve any real world problems. Perhaps maybe the greatest of all in being a coin use to pay for everyday goods and services since there is so many in supply and available as well as getting the general public excited about cryptocurrency and bringing more people into the space.

Imagine my surprise when I have been taking to a co-worker for sometime now to get them to buy bitcoin. And they just don‚Äôt seem as interested or motivated to do anything. Yet, comes to me a few days ago and says ‚ÄúI want to buy Dogecoin‚Äù...üò≥ yeah I looked just like that ‚Äòwtf Dogecoin‚Äô.

So I‚Äôm faced with the reality that dogecoin is the people‚Äôs coin. Not only that, but I‚Äôm faced with a reality...a possibility that dogecoin could even surpassed bitcoin in market cap in the future which by all stretch of the imagination seems unthinkable now. But, seeing that it‚Äôs closing in on BNB. Ethereum will be next. 

I‚Äôm just thinking of Elon musk saying wouldn‚Äôt it be funny that the joke coin becomes the number 1 coin. You can‚Äôt write this stuff.

n59mro,Chr0nosIRL,2021-05-05 06:52:02,dogecoin,"Hey Shibes,

I just wanted to put my 2 cents in on current events, mainly for new investors and people who have YOLO'd into Doge in the last few days/weeks.

The growth we are seeing right now is indeed exciting, (This is not a post to spread fear! Quite the opposite!) I have been holding since 2014 and believing that Doge will one day be a true, accepted currency. However, the growth we are seeing will, I believe, take a huge dive very soon due to one of two (or both) factors. 

1. **The hype that has been created around Elon Musk hosting Saturday Night Live and the hope that he will mention Doge.**   
If he does, there will be a sharp spike in Doge price, followed by the same sharp drop which could trigger panic selling and drive the price down. This is what happens every time he tweets, however it usually creates a higher low, which is good. If he doesn't, it may stay steady, or people may think he has abandoned Doge and sell anyway. This is a stupid notion as he has expressed his interest and love for Doge multiple times a a usable currency.
2. **The event that we hit $1.**   
There are no-doubt, many many people and corporations that have set a sell limit at the $1 mark. This means that the moment Doge reaches $1, sell orders will be triggered and billions of dollars worth of doge will be sold which will cause the price to plummet. How far, no one knows. 

**Now for the good news!** All we have to do is **HOLD**. When the price plummets after reaching $1, many people will panic sell and say its all over. This will drive price down even further, AND is a fantastic time for you and I to add more Doge to our wallets.  

All of this to say. The price goes up and down...but its on a very steady run up. Bitcoin has been pronounced dead over 400 times since it was created, and look at it! So have faith in your fellow shibes, and HODL! Every big shot investor on Wall Street said Doge would never be worth a thing, and its making millionaires out of ordinary people like you and me. Doge is going to do some AMAZING things if we **just give it the chance.**

None of this is financial advice. I'm just a poor shibe who wants to see us **all** succeed.

Doge is gaining serious momentum and any dips that occur during this time and in the near future are most likely going to be healthy. HODLers will be rewarded but I won‚Äôt be mad at anybody for taking a little bit of profit. Naysayers at this point don‚Äôt have much of an argument if you ask me. At first their argument was: ‚ÄúDoGe HaS UnLiMiTeD CaP‚Äù but come to find out only 5 billion tokens are created year in and year out. Doge has proven it‚Äôs fungibility. It can be used to purchase NBA tix (dallas mavs), baseball tix (Oakland As) and is being accepted as form of payment at large companies such as Newegg. The believers, users and HODLers of Doge give it value simply by saying it has value and acceptance of it as form of payment further drives its validity. It‚Äôs nice to have big billionaires on Doge‚Äôs side as well. I‚Äôve been a user of BTC since pre 2017 and one thing that always bugged me was bitcoin‚Äôs high transaction fees. Just last month it cost me about $15-$20 to send about $40 in BTC. What I‚Äôm understanding is that Doge can be sent with minimal transaction fees.

Nobody can predict when this will happen but it will happen.

I do only have 16 euros in my account and right now binance will not let me transact such a low amount with pancake SWAP, does anyone have alternatives and I would be so so appreciative if someone would allow me to pay them for 16 euro worth of Dogecoin.

And for the purposes of reporting, they count cryptocurrencies no matter how silly sounding they are. 

So here I am, trading in doge since around mid January. I've ridden the waves and daytraded my way up to a chunk of change from the original $200 ish I put in until my current holdings of in the region of $3k. At the current moment, I was charged 1500 in ""overpayment"" last month, and have been removed from the SSI program. 

Now my dilemma. I have rent to pay, student debt, and other assorted minor monthly bills (medical and the sort) that add up to around $1000 a month. At my current pace, daytrading doge will slaughter that amount and I can keep living, having a home, etc without relying on govt assistance. But I can't hodl. And I'm too disabled to work a regular job. And some friends I've told this to make me feel bad for trading versus hodling. Sure, theoretically, I could make more in the long run by hodling, but I have short term expenses to manage. 

Alternatively, if I dump everything, and throw it all into bills (my current coffers wouldnt even scratch the surface of my student loans) I can be put back on SSI for the measly 794 dollars a month. 

What would you do in this situation? Hodl, daytrade, or dump it all? 

For the record, my daytrading net gains are typically 3-5% per day. So I have the confidence to keep it up, but the burden of an insecure income and not being able to simply hodl have me reaching out here for your honest opinions.","I used to be on disability, but then I started trading doge, and now I face a dilemma"

So like, I'm wondering, when will there ever be a branch off token/coin to Doge? Kind of like a Doge Classic (like Etherum)? Doge is too inflated, the maximum it could ever possibly reach is around $300 a coin, and that's considering all of the world's currency is in Doge. Please correct me if I'm wrong? It was brought to my attention in a previous post last night, so I am still learning the true economics of Doge.   


Point being, Doge as it stands today, is a currency that will forever be exchanged on a bottom margin and cannot really rise too high due to the high inflation of 127 billion coins... so can we move forward to a more valuable coin to act like a ""gold"" version to the standard Doge coin we are investing in now? And then only let there be a couple hundred million that exists, and cap it? Will this ever happen? I'd invest the hell out of it, lol. Or is this not a good idea, and why?  


Not looking for any negative remarks, constructive criticism is a-okay though, but please just help to better educate me, and brainstorm, etc.","Doge Classic, or something... will there ever be a Dogecoin split?"

We are at nearly 70 cents now. People will keep buying, and those who buy at 70 cents will sure not sell at a dollar, they are not getting into it now to make a 30 percent gain.

So know the risk of trying to be ""smart"" by thinking in standard categorys, the idea that the worldwide media goes Fully on Doge-Promotion after SNL is Inevitable.

As ridiculous it may sounds for some of you, we could be at 1.50 next week if this keeps going like it does right now, and if SNL acts as afterburner.

I ask you fellow shibes, demand a cap, demand coin burns, demand listings and adoptions, and we will see this coin reach completely unprecedented levels that no one thought possible.

n5aebj,watch_abc,2021-05-05 07:43:13,dogecoin,"Longtime lurker first time poster. I bought my first bag of Dogecoin this week. Have to say that this Dogecommunity sub is amazingly humble compared to other fin subs like wsb/btc. Most of us set moonshot targets of $1 or $2 when i believe there's actually way more *moonshot* upside than that.

Elon has proclaimed DOGE as the people's coin. It's different from BTC in the sense that DOGE is way more efficient and better suited for the a high transaction frequency use-case. Like many people, I put a lot of weight in Elon's words. If he wants to make DOGE mainstream, he can. Heck he can announce tomorrow that TESLA accepts DOGE.

The way I see it, DOGE is crypto USD and BTC crypto gold. People buy BTC to *keep* and buy DOGE to *use*.

The current market cap of Gold is [11T](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjBoo2igbLwAhWBf30KHWQ0BR0QFjAQegQIBBAD&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2F8marketcap.com%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw2sdW1YO46CShNIBrc75wuI) and USD [20T](https://fiatmarketcap.com). Twice as much USD as Gold in circulation.

Our moonshot case results in DOGE having **twice** BTC's marketcap.

[Screenshot CMC 5 May 0722 GMT](https://preview.redd.it/98bbbbbv69x61.png?width=965&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=264afc035cc5f351c98741fd5f3f69c22f784f93)

*BTC = Digital Asset (Value-hold use-case)*  
*DOGE = Digital Currency (Transaction use-case)*

BTC mkt cap as of screenshot is \~$1T and DOGE \~$100M. 

A 2x marketcap implies a **$13.40** moonshot price (20 \* $0.67 = $13.40).

And there we have it. HODL to the moon!

Due to natural increase in supply, DOGE actually provides more stability as a transaction medium than fixed supply coins.",Moonshot case for Dogecoin $13.40

But I‚Äôve bought some Dogecoin and was wondering what the realistic limit of Dogecoin is? I ask this because I‚Äôve been comparing it to Bitcoin, and by the looks of it BTC has a lot less coin in circulation (around 14 million by the looks of it) and then Dogecoin has around 120 million currently circulating. This means that Dogecoin wouldn‚Äôt be able to hit as higher numbers as Bitcoin due to the supply is much higher and if it ever somehow did it would completely collapse the economy due to so much supply being worth so much money.

Unless I‚Äôm completely wrong and this isn‚Äôt how it works, would be great if someone could explain.

I was watching chart patterns and saw a dip incoming so I decided to Convert my 5700 into USD-T.

My Doge did not convert at the price it was supposed to, 0.69, but at 0.61.

No Idea why, So I converted and lost a huge amount of money. I reconverted my USD-T back to Doge suspecting it was a mistake and was only able to repurchase about 4750.

So basically I lost 1000 ish Doge in 30 seconds, no idea why. I thought converting was supposed to be 1:1 / at the current price not a lower price.

Suffice to say I'm pretty upset now, I had saved that doge for a long time and now I'm having a total anxiety attack, dry heaving and want to pretty much jump off a bridge.

Ok, we know doge is powerful but what if we can make it be EVEN MORE POWERFUL!

**- SHORT LIST VERSION -** 

This is where my strategy comes into action..

1. Buy Doge, the more the better.

2. If you are worried doge will backfire making you lose your investment. Sell a **small portion** of doge for you to breakeven..

1. BUY THE DIPS IF YOU CAN, THE MORE THE MERRIER AND HOLD! 

3.  Share this post and upvote it  and share it to other forums and investing groups. **If we don't do this then  this strategy will not work.**

4. By the time doge hits $10 or more, we will need to keep wary of big companies and media trying to deter us from DOGE. In other words at this price point, we will be seen as a somewhat serious currency, allowing big spikes. **(A bit like what happened to bitcoin)**

5. Once doge is being stabilised at a certain price point, DO NOT SELL, but wait... (ESPECIALLY TO THOSE WHO OWN A LARGE PORTION OF DOGE as this will cause the price to drop).

**- FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE DOUBTING DOGE -** 

**Doge is the one place I found a strong community who believes in this coin. Which is why you shouldn't be afraid on investing even a little bit on it, since it's sentiment is what determines its price.**

You might hear that doge has no value, but this is also true for all currencies, until big companies allow their products to be purchased with the said currency. So before you doubt it, just try it out by investing a tiny portion and check the results you get from it.

**- WHAT IF I WANT TO SELL DOGE NOW? -**

 It can be difficult on not selling, but instead of selling all of your doge coins, why not sell a tiny portion of it, and check how much you've earned from holding it for 10/11 years.

If the amount you earned is life changing, then sure sell it, But if it's not then don't sell but **HOLD.**

**- Ending -**

**So this sums up my strategy. But guys seriously try to share this if you can or even upvote it, every bit helps!**",DOGE ULTIMATE GAME PLAN TO $1000!!

""Checking whether you have 2FA enabled""

I have everything, my Wallet ID, Password, old email from 2014 with ID, everything everything correct, everything that was needed to log in to that Dogecoin wallet in 2014.

I read everywhere that there is huge amount of people that have same ""2FA enabled"" problem without any solution. 

How can this be so overlooked as being nothing?
As being something to be put up with ... how can we be put up with that?!?

Maybe when DOGE was cheap, but now it is about money, BIG money and where BIG money is any fun ends immediately right away.

Dogechain.info should allow people to log in to these old prior 2FA wallets otherwise they are literally committing crime.

How can they dare to not allow people to access their money due technical problem on their website? That 2FA stuck/error is only and only their own problem, Dogechain problem, not ours!

At that times of 2014 there was no 2FA mechanism on Dogechain wallet to choose from at all, so why should we really care whether they fail to check 2FA being enabled or not ‚Äì that is their problem, not ours! Only thier. We have everything needed to login and whey should allow us to login otherwise they should spend some serious jail time for doing this ‚Äì as this what they are doing is crime!

n5arcv,RandomKBR,2021-05-05 08:08:56,dogecoin,"DOGE is extremly expensive right now. I know people dont want to hear this but major investors would have made millions and will be ready to pull the rug while the hype is strong.
I personally think that swapping into to lower alts to multiply your profits is the best choice right now and have done so myself with 80% of my DOGE. I'm not going to list any alts as this isn't about trying to pump what i believe in.
But think of it like this: 
If you put $1000 in DOGE and have made $5000 you can then rotate that into a lower alt and find 400% again(plenty that have this potential or more) that would put you on $20000 instead of waiting on doge to go up to $3 which i believe is highly unlikely. Be safe, be smart before the big dogs outsmart you.

n5asfs,MIST_,2021-05-05 08:11:04,dogecoin,"Hi All,

Several years ago my business partner and I ran an exchange called weselldoges. At one point we migrated servers and i copied the wallet.dat file between the servers while still running. Unfortunately the ""old"" wallet performed a transaction and a portion of our wallet was put into a change address. As you probably understand the key to this change address was not brought along into the ""new"" wallet and the coins were lost.

I've now found the 2 disks where this wallet existed and i'm considering trying to recover the wallet, something i didn't really spend much time doing back then since it was not a significant amount of doge at that point in time. The crux is that the 2x500gb disks were running raid1 on some motherboard, unknown which brand or model. I've attempted just hooking one up to a linux computer and run fdisk on it but no partitions were found. 

Is it safe to say that these coins are lost forever, the disk should be hung on a wall as a memorial, or do we want to go on a recovery journey together?

Let me point out some facts to highly suggest the value crossing 1$  
1. SNL is yet to happen. Elon Musk is a billionaire who supports the wildest of things. You think he WONT mention it, and it's potential on saturday? You're logical reasonings seems to be impaired

2. We have had a massive pump from celebrities all over the world ONLY today. This means the best is yet to come. WE are underestimating the power of the bull.

3. Doge is going to be listen on COINBASE ANYTIME FROM NOW. Their Rosetta API is almost developed, and has merges every single day (Source: Github). Once this is developed and deployed, it is a matter of a few hours to have the trading open on Coinbase.

4. Coinbase share has dropped significantly, because other cryptos are losing and doge is winning. COINBASE WANTS TO LIST DOGE.

5. The stability and the fact that we have millions of dollars printed every day only means that the Doge currency holds larger resemblance to real currencies. Do you really think a currency with only 21 million coins would be sustainable? With growing population, you'd need a growing inflation. Otherwise people without Bitcoins/Etheriums would starve to death.

Do not let greed overpower you. If you see profits that you‚Äôre happy with, take them. If you think doge actually has potential and isn‚Äôt a pump/dump scheme (Most alt coins are), then keep holding. It does have potential with the recognition it‚Äôs getting. Once this hype dies down. Doge will go back to consolidating for possibly a long time. What I can guarantee is there will be a huge crash on Saturday. 

There‚Äôs no way the whales will just sit back and keep watching. Just like the 4/20 event They participated in this, then they will dump. I don‚Äôt think people remember doge dropping from $.24 to $.14 in MINUTES a few weeks ago. The long term is what scares me about doge. 

It takes so much money for the value of this coin to actually go up. It‚Äôs only $.70 and has an $83 billion dollar market cap. If the whales dump most of their coins, and there‚Äôs still a market for doge. That‚Äôs when you can consider this",What I‚Äôve learned from being in this subreddit.

After loosing two of the closest people to me in life within a month, both barely a month ago, and with one of them my income? The Doge was all I had left to hope for. So after much thought and calculating, I made the decision to sell half once it equaled to double what my remaining car payment was, plus taxes, and leave the rest in there for moon landings. That way, either way, I can say I was able to pay off my car, and have some financial breathing room while I get my life sorted out again. AND I still have plenty when I see it land on the moon!!

So I did it. i sold a little less than half of what I have been keeping warm this whole time and keeping the other half in to finish baking.

n5b9mg,UncleJellett,2021-05-05 08:45:05,dogecoin,"Listen, I'm a sophomore economics student, so my math could be wrong here. I invite anyone with a more qualified opinion or larger brain to leave their input in the comments.
My buddy asked me earlier today what his odds were of becoming a millionaire from Dogecoin, saying it would need to reach $240USD/1Doge for this to be so. I immediately recalled something I read somewhere which said that 'Dogecoin could never reach Bitcoin prices because it would be worth more than the global economy,' which got me thinking, how high exactly would Doge have to go to be worth more than the global economy? The answer: not really that high. 
Currently, there are 129 billion (hereinafter ""b"") Dogecoin in circulation. As of 2019, the global GDP was 89.8 trillion (hereinafter ""t."") If we divide 89.8t by the Doge supply of 129b, we get $696. So by this calculation, if Doge reached $696USD/1Doge, the market cap would be equivalent to the global GDP from less than two years ago (and likely more than it is currently due to the pandemic.)
However, this doesn't take into account the future. The annual 5b Doge injections, the annual global GDP growth, and how the economy recovers from the pandemic are all very important factors to consider here. Firstly, we should evaluate the inverse relationship between increasing Doge supply and increasing global GDP. Doge supply increases by a fixed amount, meaning that the percentage that it increases by yearly decreases. The global GDP increases at a fluctuating percentage rate, but generally does increase. Between 2015 and 2019, the global GDP increased by an average of 3.368% annually. Estimates suggest that in 2020, the global GDP dropped about 4.5%, leaving it around 85.8t. As a college student, and with the nature of economics, I'm not in a position to predict how the economy will recover from the pandemic, so for this analysis I will assume the global GDP will continue to increase by 3.368% annually (and yes I understand that it will more than likely exceed this for the next year or few.)
Starting with the 85.8t estimated global GDP from 2020 and raising it by 3.368% annually, the global GDP would be approximately 123.58t in 2031. That's an increase of 44%. Now with the Doge supply increasing by 55b in the same timeframe to 179b in 2031, this is also an increase of 44%. But because the supply of Doge will go on to increase at a slower rate than the global GDP, Doge's breakeven price with the global economy will decrease. And bear in mind that my estimate for the global GDP increase is very conservative, so Doge's breakeven price would be even lower than the $690 it would be in 2031.
As the global GDP continues to increase in larger intervals as the years go on and Dogecoin's supply increase remains stagnant, the amount that the breakeven price drops by annually will increase. However, given that over the next 10 years it will only drop by a relatively insignificant amount, we can take it that Dogecoin's market cap will exceed the value of the global economy at around $700. This is a sort of price ceiling in that if it hit that price, the concept of currency would essentially be null and void. But realistically, we can assume that our governments would prevent it from ever getting that high for the same of preserving civilization as we know it. If it ever happened, I could see governments placing sanctions as it approaches $100-$200USD/1Doge, but ultimately that's just speculation. 
In summary, Dogecoin's market cap would clap the global economy if Dogecoin reached $700/USD, and likely earlier than that as speculation that it would continue to that level would cause mass panic. So that's what the hard price ceiling is according to my logic. Realistically speaking, (albeit only based off of a gut feeling) I would be genuinely surprised if Doge broke $5. I don't foresee it breaking $10 unless there is some serious unrelated hyperinflation. Either way, we're 1000% away from $5 now, so hopefully you fellas can secure an additional 10x ROI from here on out. But until that day, cheers fellas.

I only used 1 x PC for this, and I still own it (although it was my daily work machine for a number of years).  Back in 2017 I decided to sell the doge and tried to find the wallet but to no avail.  From memory I think I might have tried to re-install Multidoge at that point as it wouldn't sync with the blockchain and I thought this would fix it.  It didn't.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I thought, screw it, who cares it's only worth about ¬£50 anyway (in 2017).  Well, as we all know, fast forward now and it's worth a whole lot more.

&amp;#x200B;

Searching the hard drive only brings back wallet files from 2017 and not 2013.  They do not contain my doge.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have any suggestions at all on how I might find the wallet?  I am thinking my only option is probably some sort of forensic tool that might be able to find the data on the hard drive?  Although I shudder to think how many blocks etc have been written over on that drive since I used it for like 5/6 years.

&amp;#x200B;

Any help is massively appreciated.",Lost Wallet - plz help!

n5be9s,idoubtedbelgium,2021-05-05 08:54:30,dogecoin,"Here I am a typical millennial. Sensitive and not known for making decisions from a financial perspective.

While my friends studied something ‚Äòfunctional‚Äô I chased my dream and studied piano on a conservatory.

I choose a live without any financial security. I am used to making ends meet, I lived cheap. I could manage and not even did bad.

But then the pandemic happend.

My income vanished, worked as a self-employed because there are no contract to get in art. Financial stress almost everyday. No compensation what so ever. I have a big student debt and I have no clue how to pay for it. I just turned 31 and I see my old friends buying houses and starting family‚Äôs. I get physically ill by the idea. Its not the house, not the family but the pressure, how will i ever manage to do the same and not dying from financial pressure. My parents are babyboomers, bought a house cheap and got financial lucky by zeitgeist. With a eclectic mind I read allot about what is going on in the world and it makes me sad and most of the time it feels unfair. Bad luck by zeitgeist.

I was not a dedicated Reddit-user but after reading about Gamestop I got active. The Dogecoin appeared and I was laughing like my .. off.

Just for fun I bought 3500 coins at 0,048 without any knowledge or predictions.

Everytime I walked by a real-estate agent. I am internally shouting ‚ÄòHow the hell am I suppose to pay this?‚Äô I get mad. Getting a mortgage is impossible in my situation but asking rent for double price of mortgage is no problem. I get mad. Who invented this badly functioning system. Badluck by zeitgeist.

Today I walked by a real-estate agent again and I started laughing. As loud as everytime i read about it for the past 4 months. For the first time I realized that Doge is more then a great joke.

Doge is the middle finger against the .. up world where rich people get richer and poor people stay poor.

Doge is the currency of the former working-class who luckily got the opportunity to study. The battle of our parents and grandparents. I‚Äôm thankful for the opportunity‚Äôs they gave us. But the greed in the same generation makes us pay everyday.

Again, Doge is the middle finger against billionaires and millionaires who make money they don't need from people without money who need it badly.

Doge is the way to fix this system, this unfair world. Your second car is a Mercedes, just for the weekend? Nice for you men i just like to have a house without dying of financial stress. I also like to live in a place for once where my bedroom is not my living room and kitchen.

But please,

you can have your billions, please keep it. We don‚Äôt want your billions. It's worthless to us. Because what you never change? 1 doge is 1 doge.

Doge gives us hope.

No money in the world buys you hope. Only 1 coin does.

Not even close with my amount of Doge to buy a house, and even when it collapses I will find a way to manage again but for the first time in 15 years I was dreaming today.

Much love,",Dogecoin is more then a joke. My Theory

n5bhms,Waxlyricals,2021-05-05 09:01:01,dogecoin,"Ok you Hodlers, it drives me insane how few of you understand the wider money markets and how THEY drive the crypto price as much as, if not more than people buying and selling small amounts does.

The main driver of EVERYTHING are the debt markets. Primarily the one to watch is US 10yr yield as this is the one that all of the money men look to.

These are US Government Bonds, sold on the financial markets offering a rate of return to anyone who 'buys their debt'

A healthy economy and currency can see the Government offer an attractive rate of return and investors queuing up to buy the debt, knowing that its a safe harbour for their wealth to be stored.

An unhealthy outlook for the economy and currency sees the Government have to offer higher and higher yields to attract people, institutions and other Governments to take the risk and hold the debt.

The entire financial market, from crypto to precious metals is controlled and affected by the debt markets. ALL OF IT

The US economy and dollar are tanking right now, so people want to hedge their bets and find alternative places to store their wealth. This is primarily why Crypto and Doge are taking off in value. However, these values are affected minute by minute as 'financial news and outlooks' are updated with new data.

So when Doge dips, its more than likely not due to 'paper hand' sellers but a change in the 10yr yield so quit yelling or b1tching about fellow HODLers as you are probably wrong in doing so. In all liklihood its some change or update in the DEBT MARKET that has driven the rise or fall üöÄüöÄüöÄüåõ",Its not 'Paper Hands' driving the dips

Words cannot do justice to how bad i feel right now!

Bought a little Doge in February. Rode the waves, bought a little more in the dips here and there.

Scared myself when we had the huge dip after the 0.45 high a couple of weeks ago but I kept my nerve and held on. 

Thinking it'll never get past 0.50 anytime soon, and my need for a new car, I decided to paper hand when it got back to 0.42 two nights ago. You can only imagine the feeling of seeing what has happened in the last 48 hours. I am truly gutted.

I can't complain, I've turned $500 into $10000, but if I'd have held a little longer I'd have double that. 

Seriously, unless you need that money, HODL! 

Also, I feel naked without my Doge. Weird to say, but being part of the ride is a big part of it. I'll be getting back in when I see a decent dip, but now I fear I've fallen off the rocket. Lesson learned!",I'm an idiot!

n5bx9b,Gagulta,2021-05-05 09:31:45,dogecoin,"Dogecoin has taken crypto markets by storm. Over the last few months a once obscure ‚Äòjoke currency‚Äô has been transformed into an economic powerhouse; a top five cryptocurrency and an epic underdog story. We‚Äôve seen the lives of thousands of its supporters transformed; people are paying off their parents‚Äô mortgages; saving their pets‚Äô lives with expensive surgeries; donating significant sums to shelters and charities. These early, heartening victories are the result of powerful social memes stoked by media hype, social media and so on. Once Doge‚Äôs meteoric rise becomes socially accepted (for want of a better term), it‚Äôs entirely possible that the resultant decrease in hype sees Doge coin taper off in value. Of course, we can‚Äôt expect the current skyrocketing price of ƒê to sustain itself indefinitely, but we‚Äôre all here because we anticipate a continued upwards trend. This is where I believe game theory comes into play.

For those of you who haven‚Äôt heard of game theory, or don‚Äôt know what it means, I‚Äôve stolen the definition from Investopedia:

*Game theory is a theoretical framework for conceiving social situations among competing players. In some respects, game theory is the science of strategy, or at least the optimal decision-making of independent and competing actors in a strategic setting.*

When I studied economics at A-level, my teacher illustrated game theory with a famous example: the prisoner dilemma. The prisoner dilemma is as follows:

Two supposed criminals are arrested for theft. The police have no strong evidence to convict them, and therefore require a confession to press charges. The prisoners are kept in individual cells to avoid collusion and are interrogated in solitary rooms. Both prisoners are ultimately presented with the following options:

I. Both prisoners confess and each receive five years imprisonment.

II. One prisoner rats but the other does not. The rat gets three years in prison and the other gets nine years.

III. Neither prisoner confesses and they both receive two years.

In this scenario, the ideal outcome for the criminals is that neither confess. However, because the prisoners had no chance to collude prior to their interrogations, neither knows whether the other will snitch. It‚Äôs clear that the best-case scenario for both criminals relies upon trust and integrity, but will one prisoner snitch on the other if he believes he‚Äôll get a better deal?

How do we apply this theory to Dogecoin?

There are a variety of reasons that people have got involved with the People‚Äôs Crypto. I would wager that most of us are here because we want to make as much money as possible. Others still like the idea of a crypto currency owned by and utilised for the working class. Some want to stick it to whales, billionaires and other bourgeois degenerates. Some just want to get in on what they perceive to be a pump-and-dump scheme. Regardless of your reasoning, if you own Doge, you most likely want to see it do well.

To maximise our returns and get the most from Doge (whatever that means to you), we must collaborate to a certain extent. I‚Äôm very new to crypto trading. I only got involved because of Doge and I‚Äôll admit I have a lot less to lose than most people on this sub. With that said, I also stand to gain an enormous amount, just like everyone else who has invested to date. I did some quick maths this morning and I‚Äôve worked out that if Doge somehow hit the price of Ethereum from April this year, I‚Äôd make half a million quid. That‚Äôs a mind-blowing, life changing sum of money for anyone in my shoes. Now, I had a discussion with an old school friend on Saturday who‚Äôd also jumped on to the Doge train off the back of all the media hype. He was adamant that Elon Musk will discuss Doge on SNL at the weekend, Doge will hit a dollar and he‚Äôll cash out for a tidy profit of ¬£500. I can‚Äôt tell anyone how to think or what to do with their money, but this attitude to me is counterintuitive to the overall success of the whole. I explained to him that I intend to hold past a dollar, that I expect the value to drop as automatic sale orders are triggered, but that the hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of Doge holders who see this as a long-term investment will simply buy the dip and keep holding.

For this line of thinking to work, we need to get as many people on the same thought process as possible. Here are the thoughts of an amateur economist with little to lose and everything to gain by allying myself with the good people of this sub:

¬∑ Dispel the ‚ÄúDoge to $1 memes‚Äù. We need to be consistently aiming a step higher than what is feasible in the short term. People need a reason to hold, and reminding them that $1 is just the most recent in a long chain of milestones might help to convince people to sit tight and turn paper hands into diamond ones. If $1 looks like the next big goal, start memeing about $4.20. When $4.20 looks achievable, push for $10. We need to keep the target always just out of reach. As Alan Watts said (and as I‚Äôll now paraphrase terribly,) the good guys always have to be seen to be winning, but must never win outright or else the fun is over. Every time it looks like we‚Äôre close to our goal, we have to push the goal higher.

¬∑ Accept that the current exponential growth is not sustainable. There will be price crashes. I would presume from my limited knowledge that we might see a crash next week if Elon does speak about Doge on SNL. There are people who have been holding now for months and years. Cashing out at a dollar might make them overnight millionaires. Fair play and congratulations to them! They are the early success stories of our movement. The ones who kick started the journey and are now stepping off because they‚Äôve reached their destination are passing the torch on to the $0.10, $0.20 and $0.30 buyers. I‚Äôm essentially reiterating what thousands of people have already said on this sub but continue to hold! Remember, you don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on in every other Doge holder‚Äôs head, but for this to work you have to faith in your fellow man. You have to assume that the person to the next of you has the same integrity in her heart as you do.

¬∑ Discuss Doge! Collaborate with as many people as possible! Crypto trading is a game and anyone who says otherwise is missing the point (and the fun). To win the game we have to play together. If you‚Äôve just made ¬£10,000 of a ¬£50 investment and you still have a few hundred coins, consider sending some to a friend. If you and four of your mates each only have ¬£20 to invest, why not pool your resources? We only have power if we work together for the common good.

¬∑ Be kind. Above all else, I think this one is most important. We must all be kind and understanding to one another. I always assumed crypto and stock communities would be full of the sort of people who‚Äôd sell their mother off to make a few quid. More fool me! I‚Äôve seen great acts of loving kindness from the people of this specific community, and I think that is where the bulk of our strength lies. The whales, the millionaires and billionaires, the massive faceless corporations, their only motivation is to see us fail because their power over us is reliant upon us remaining poor, ignorant, and divided. We have a genuine chance with Doge to create moderate wealth for millions of people stuck in 9-5 grinds, precarious work or outright joblessness. I‚Äôm holding Doge because I love people, and because I know that so many others stand to gain from me simply holding my nerve.

¬∑ Dogecoin‚Äôs value is primarily supported by belief. It‚Äôs as simple as that. Yes, the more Doge is accepted as a legitimate means of payment, the more it‚Äôs name is brought up in the media, the higher the value will climb, but the only power you as an individual most likely hold, is to believe that Dog‚Äôs value will increase. If you do that, and if you believe that everyone else holding thinks the same way, Doge will go to the moon.

Thanks for reading my effortpost. Good luck to everyone!

I personally believe in 3 days it will hit $0.80 and might even reach $1.

Not a financial advice, but:
- it is NOT a time to sell
- it IS still a time to buy in

After it hits $1 there will be a massive sell, yes. We cannot do much here because people will want profits. And TBH it is fine, they deserve that. But it won‚Äôt be the end, after a little while it will bounce back even stronger.

**Intro**  
Hi everybody ! I have seen a lot of people talking about the need to increase the number of companies accepting the Doge as a method of payment. I was asked to make a quick tutorial about how to do it on Shopify shop, as I have one and we accept DogeCoin since yesterday.  
Just to be clear, I have absolutly no interest about speaking about the PaymentCoin app. It's just the best solution I have found so far, as CoinBase Merchant is not accepting Doge. (For now).  


**Tutorial**

**1.** Go to [https://www.coinpayments.net/register](https://www.coinpayments.net/register)

**2.** Create an account as a business (it's free).   
You will receive and email to verify your account : 

https://preview.redd.it/iorjwyuro9x61.png?width=583&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ef07bc540624ffc1c589efab7d7cdef6ed6d3e9

**3.** When you click on the link inside the email, you will be asked to connect yourself with your ID and Password you defined at the 2nd step.  


[Login phase](https://preview.redd.it/r3z26rz1p9x61.png?width=591&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05d9db60ac711681bd6547842565db8857ab4531)

**4.** When it's done, enter the 4 digit code they will send you on your email.  


**5.** Now you are on the Account Setup Wizard page. Choose **Merchant.**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/msc0zn8yp9x61.png?width=662&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e83060685f6bd71c5433a42a1a408a5fe7eb369

&amp;#x200B;

**6.** Now the Payment Method step. Choose the second option ""Only Coins I select"".  


https://preview.redd.it/6am9ajc1q9x61.png?width=815&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=30458c0548931c8d5605a468d1ecfe6fe2568aab

&amp;#x200B;

**7.** **You will arrive on a page with all coins accepted by CoinPayment.** You already know the only one we want here. So use CTRL+F, write down ""Doge"", and you will find our favorite coin on the list as fast as we're going to the moon.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**What are ASAP &amp; To Balance ?**  
&gt;  
&gt;**- ASAP** will send your doge directly to the payment Adress you will write down.  
\- **To Balance** will stock the Doge inside your CoinPayment Wallet.   
I suggest you to begin with the To Balance method, and then switch to ASAP when you have defined a wallet for your company. 

Be sure to select both doge protocols.  


https://preview.redd.it/t074djpcr9x61.png?width=1077&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fa4ddb31846bf7b535e5d2f4acf049ee212d5970

I encourage you to don't touch anything else for now.

Then confirm at the bottom of the page :

And return to the Setup Wizard 

&amp;#x200B;

**8. Now don't bother you with the next step.** Just click here :  
[https://www.coinpayments.net/acct-home](https://www.coinpayments.net/acct-home)

And in theory, in the navbar on the top, you will now have an ""Account"" option. Click on it and select ""**Account Settings**"".  


https://preview.redd.it/aq6zwm4vt9x61.png?width=1189&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aab3b223b80e5a97c660d7d6108e7e4684165d7f

**9. Your merchand ID and IPN Secret.**

You will have to copy them in Shopify on next steps. So it's good to know where to find them.

&amp;#x200B;

[Merchand Id.](https://preview.redd.it/ew6yy9t5u9x61.png?width=1188&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f32a85c2426f0cbe5bc8083fd029d7c6091aa056)

[You have to DEFINE your IPN yourself. I suggest you something strong and maybe random.](https://preview.redd.it/5wy129o9u9x61.png?width=1157&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b993d89c44cb520d72136ad6f8f283b092c23905)

**10. Got to shopify  &gt; Parameters &gt; Payments**  


https://preview.redd.it/1x4ybfxnu9x61.png?width=1219&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2eba9d56020228d8fc6d847fb128c2e09eb06b47

**11**. On this page, scroll and find ""Choose alternative Payment""  


https://preview.redd.it/jiqb40qru9x61.png?width=612&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=68eaaa17ae01f2cf4137dd3c8190d0e624df7418

Then search for ""Coinpayment"" in the list and select it.

**12.** Copy-paste your Merchand ID and IPN Secret from **step 9.** 

*Processing img kz69vk64v9x61...*

**Then, you just have to activate it.** 

&amp;#x200B;

Congratulations, you shop now accepts dogecoin ! üê∂üöÄ üåõ You can tell your community.  
I hope this step-by-step post will help a lot of Shopify business owner to accept Doge and help us send it to the moon.

n5c8g4,Slayerdamaster111,2021-05-05 09:53:30,dogecoin,"I think that one day dogecoin could potentially reach the likes of bitcoin. It sounds crazy but I actually took a moment to think and compare Dogecoin and bitcoin, I‚Äôm not going to do any math or crazy calculations to see how much Dogecoin would need to be worth, I‚Äôm just going to share my thoughts. Dogecoin since its deflationary can be used as a currency, and 5 billion coins a year won‚Äôt end up affecting the price that much. I also thought upon the practicality, dogecoin seems like a much friendlier coin to the people than bitcoin, let's say bitcoin did not have the big lead that it has now and these were both new cryptos. Would you choose the one that is based on a dog and meme culture or something that seems more business like? I think the only thing separating doge from becoming great is the thought that Bitcoin is the main crypto, or that it‚Äôs on top. If they started at the same place I think doge would come out on top, but the thing is now doge has to go through that journey and it seems more difficult now. We still have many more events to come with doge as it‚Äôs picking up traction in the world, we are truly still in the beginning of what it could become, if it keeps picking up it could truly become the currency of the world. I feel like these thoughts may be all over the place because I‚Äôm just writing them down out of things I‚Äôve heard and thought about but let me know your opinion, do you think it sounds crazy, or realistic?",Could doge be the currency of the world?

&amp;#x200B;

I am so happy for everyone that invested especially my loved ones, but man its a horrible feeling.

whenever a coin explodes and i could have made a few hundreds that pain to me is intense it gives me suicidal thoughts, losing money invested is NEVER even near as much pain as losing on potential gain, when elon started talking about dogecoin i told myself that if i miss out on this i'd regret it so i started safe and invested like 300 dollars, then i tried to invest 300 again in another exchange this failed and they refused to give me my 6000 coins which had gained around 100 in value while they were frozen so i told myself that i didn't want this to be a regret so i decided to put all i had in another exchance to make up for that loss so it wouldn't be a regret 

I decided to wipe my bank accounts while my heart was beating hard, i also told myself any bills that need paying i can sell stuff i also told myself this is a huge risk but i am taking it, i cleared my accounts so much that the exchange locked me out it could have ended up in the stupidest decision i could have made but i still did it because i knew noone would know about my failure but me, i still regret i couldn't pay the last 400 or so that i attempted at the time which was the last money i had, i feel that was like 10k or 6k coins which i will surely overthink, but i did all i could and was truly ok with losing it, when it comes to me i overthink everything i worry about every thing, every detail matters to me and that annoys some people, but this kind of weakness forced me to wipe my accounts of money i needed, not caring about what happens to me after because to me this life isn't worth any thing any way and it's simply a tool to work for the better one and everything i have and own is simply resources, and now the 10k i invested is now worth 14k

&amp;#x200B;

so i feel if you have any type of mental issues you can use it to your advantage, i am holding this and i am going to hold it untill it has the chance of crashing because i am in this for the true long run, i am not going to cash out 14k and buy a nice tv then regret it for the rest of my life not even 35k is worth that mental pain, i will only consider those risks at 500k when i truly feel i can live off it.

&amp;#x200B;

i also think we should respect people selling and playing it safe, we are not all risk takers and thats ok, because those people value their life and they don't want to take risks, i don't value mine so i will take any risk if i feel it's worth it.",my mental illnesses helped me invest in dogecoin

n5cpoo,golavan1592,2021-05-05 10:26:00,dogecoin," When I started in the crypto world I was very excited but I didn't want to mess it up by putting them in any wallet, so I started to research about the types that exist and which ones people recommend. 

At first, I read about hardwares wallets and paper wallets which are usually in the form of QRs, hard disks or USBs. Honestly, they may be the most secure as they stay offline but if you ever lose them, I would lose all my cryptos so I quickly discarded them. Then I found out other desktop wallets that can be downloaded and you can access them from your computer. They didn't convince me either, because of the lack of usability. I also read about online wallets, and in this case I liked the fact that you can access them from any device with wifi, but I stepped back because the security fell on others (...although in these cases it is also inevitable).

Finally I got the mobile wallet because it is the desktop version adapted to the mobile and it is easier for me because wherever I am I can see how my crypto is going. Basically, It's like a traditional wallet.

Researching, at the end my first option was another one but it was not available in my country, so I decided to go for Exodus.

What a big mistake! What happened next is that I lost all my cryptos! 

These days I've read people saying that from the beginning Exodus didn't seem safe to them because it doesn't ask you for passcode or information to create your account, and also I've seen this post from someone who had the same thing happen to him as me 10 days ago [https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/mxv737/i\_lost\_all\_my\_doge\_on\_exodus\_wallet\_and\_btw\_some/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/mxv737/i_lost_all_my_doge_on_exodus_wallet_and_btw_some/) 

I had a lot of money invested: I lost NANO, DOGE (although I didn't have much, but seeing the rise of these days makes me even more mad), ETH and some more, but the one that hurt me the most was INXT because I discovered that altcoin since its beginnings and I think it has a lot of potential. On top of that, since yesterday it can be directly traded from Coinbase Wallet, so now that I will probably buy it again I will switch to that wallet and put them there, as I have seen it is one of the most reliable... Although I don't even know what to trust now. What do you think? Do you know of other more secure wallets?",I LOST MY CRYPTOS because of this insecure wallet

n5cqcb,Individual_Call_8602,2021-05-05 10:27:17,dogecoin,"You're not late, just know that at roughly 65 cents, it will take a lot more to invest to make a sizeable return. When someone bought say 10 dollars of Doge at .04 cents in February, that's the equivalent of 250 doge. If Doge hit a dollar, that invested 10 dollars becomes roughly 240-250 actual dollars in value etc.

If you invested 10 dollars now at a value of .65 for example, and doge hits a dollar, you'll make roughly 15 dollars.

Long story short, it's not too late to get in on it cuz Doge could easily surpass a dollar in the future, but you need to know you're at much higher risks for loss when it goes through a crash if you panic and sell. And you'll need to invest a lot more than someone from three months ago to make a sizeable return. But you still could make a big return if Doge goes into the value of two dollars or more.

My only recommendation is don't forfeit anything to the purchase of crypto and stocks that you aren't able to be okay with losing. Don't put your bill money into it, your food money or something and expect to get rich overnight because this is a massive game of patience. Spare a couple dollars when you can and don't worry about people who are dropping thousands cuz they can. Invest only what is responsible for you.","""Is it too late to get in on it??

I was wondering if anyone on this page is as nervous as me about all this spiking in doge? i bought about 12k shares back when it was less than a penny i believe last novemberish and told myself to keep buying and holding. Then i made my biggest mistake which was listening to articles i read online that pretty much said doge had zero chance of hitting 10 cents so i didnt put the money in that i should have.. Huge bummer looking back now. Needless to say i bought back into doge at around 15 cents a share later and about half the shares, and convinced myself it wont go up much from here but maybe i can make a few more dollars. SO now i was left with 5.6k doge instead of 12k i held that all the way till last night. i panic sold when it went from 60 to 50 cents... SO to end my long rant i rebought at a loss cause it started to spike up last night, so much that i couldnt even fking sleep thinking about the money i pretty much lit on fire and threw away. So here i sit with around 6k shares of doge trying to see if anyone else had any suggestions in staying even keeled, or if anyone else had the same panic buying and selling im having. Also i for a little filler i am virtually brand new to stocks entirely so that probably doesnt help.",new to reddit and doge looking for insight.

I joined the family few days ago and I'm pretty new to cryptocurrency trading (Just bought few BTCs some years ago). I remember the having a wallet part outside of the trading website to secure your money but:

I'm actually trading (Or HODLing) with Binance. I'm all-in with the x5 Isolated Margin because I know Doge will skyrocket (I'm in a very low risk now because of recent new all time high price). The thing is I can't send my DOGE to a wallet because I'm with x5 my money thanks to the margin. Even before that, when I was just trading my FIAT, I didn't send any DOGE to the wallet.

Is it really that dangerous to have my DOGE on Binance wallet instead of a ""personal"" one? I mean... What are the chances that they get hacked and I lose all my money? Don't they have something like an insurance?

n5d1k3,ivannorin,2021-05-05 10:47:57,dogecoin,"Sorry, my English is poor, I will use google translator. This is the thought that struck me tonight.

Repeatedly Elon Musk said that the growth of dogecoin is held back only by large wallets. He also said that doge is the cryptocurrency of the future, the world's cryptocurrency. Musk even went into conflict with the SES because of the dogecoin, but still continues to force him.

It should be borne in mind that the collapse of Dogecoin would be a very strong blow to Musk's reputation in the world. De facto, Musk has become the face of dogecoin.

From this I can conclude that Musk knows exactly what he is doing. Perhaps he has already somehow reached an agreement with the owners of large wallets and is not afraid that they will bring Dogecoin down. Maybe she is the owner of these wallets herself. His actions also lead to the fact that people buy cars, pay off mortgages, buy houses.

Thus, Elon Musk gave money to people, and people should be grateful to him. With this money, people will be able to buy cybertrucks from Tesla, thereby greatly dispersing Musk's companies. Giving people money so they can enrich your businesses is a new word in marketing. This kind of marketing genius should already be in the textbooks.

Musk is also gaining immense popularity, this may well give him the opportunity to apply for the presidency of the United States, and be elected.

Hi folks! I was curious if anyone could recommend an app that has the highest daily limit with transferring from a chase bank account.

For context, I was ready to dump a large amount of money from my checking account to purchase more DOGECOIN, but I was met with the $2500 limit for the day. I missed out big time as that was $.20 ago.

I currently use Uphold, so the only option is to purchase from my bank or debit card, directly to Uphold. There is no option to move the USD to uphold account and then purchase. It all happens at once.

Help me help us help Doge!

n5d6pu,elliemorenie,2021-05-05 10:57:33,dogecoin,"My babies, my fellow shibes, I invested in DOGE back in January as a way to get comfortable with financial loss. I have a lot of trauma surrounding money, so part of what I wanted to do was invest and embrace risk.

 I put about $350 into DOGE, half into an encrypted dogecoin wallet, and half into RH. My $350 is almost worth $10,000 now, and my only regret is that I didn‚Äôt invest more at the time. I‚Äôve never really been afraid or tempted to sell, so I set it and forget it and one day it just skyrocketed!!!

n5d6ym,Parkhaus,2021-05-05 10:58:02,dogecoin,"There's probably quite a few of these out there, but I found myself reading through write-ups when I started this, and they got convoluted so quickly. I recently helped out a friend at work who knows nothing about computers, or mining, but had an old rig laying around that could do a little bit of hash. So I thought I'd share my right up, no decisions, no BS, just follow the sequence, double click your batch file and you're mining.

So if you don't want to learn what a pool is, don't want to learn what each mining program does, you just wanted mind some of that sweet Doge, without further Ado here you go.

You'll be using T-rex miner. Not much to know about it, other than you'll never have to double click and run the Trex.exe,, you'll start mining by double clicking your "".bat"" file. In this case, for DOGE, you'll create a "".bat"" file telling the miner where to mine, and that will be what you double click to get started, but ONLY after you've replaced my DOGE coin address with your own. This is important.. Thus why I've bolded it down below lol

So to get started follow the instructions below:

Step one: Download Exodus Wallet, and set it up. You'll make a password, and get a series of like 12 words to keep for recovery purposes. Save those somewhere safe. This is super important. https://www.exodus.com/download/ 

Step two: Find your DOGE address by clicking on DOGEcoin in your wallet, and clicking on ""Receive"". Your address should look something like ""DNf5xokaHEzZjWtkeUWS6wc8A79rnSFZBU"" (this is mine btw, tips are always appreciated!) 

NOTE: Step three is optional, but at the very least can reduce power consumption if you don't want to overclock anything! 

Step three: Download MSI Afterburner. A good solid, low risk overclock will be something like -150 on your core clock, power limit at 80%, Temp limit at 80C, and Memory clock will be dependent on your card. For my GTX 1070 I run the memory at +580, but I think the 30 series cards can hit like +1100 safely. I've seen a decent bump in hash at the +0 core, but I choose not to underclock my core for the hashrate increase. If YOU DON'T want to overclock anything, still download afterburner but only pull down your power limit. This will rescue your hashrate but also your power consumption. Hash is linear to your power limit. 
Also make sure you're running the latest NVidia drivers. If you haven't downloaded GeForce experience yet, now would be a great time to do that. Keeps your card updated at all times! 

Step Four: Use my referral code https://unmineable.com/?ref=o96o-310f and input your DOGE coin address. This will give you a pool fee of only 0.75% instead of 1%, and me as well. Team work makes the dream work.

Step Five: Download t-rex miner from here https://github.com/trexminer/T-Rex/releases/download/0.20.1/t-rex-0.20.1-win.zip -- no install neccessary just extract the zip file to a folder. I named mine so eloquently ""Mining"".

Step Six: Copy one of the random "".bat"" files in your mining folder that contains the ""t-rex.exe"" program (for example, copy CFX-nanopool.bat), and make a duplicate. Rename that file ""t-rex DOGE start.bat"", then right click and click ""Edit"" to open it in notepad.

Step Seven: Paste this into that .bat file: 


t-rex.exe -a ethash -o stratum+tcp://ethash.unmineable.com:3333 -u DOGE:DNf5xokaHEzZjWtkeUWS6wc8A79rnSFZBU.myminer#cw0i-ege7 -p x -w rig0
pause

NOTE: Replace my DOGE address with your new one from Exodus. I mean, you don't HAVE to, you could mine to MY wallet if you WANT to :) :)

Step Eight: Double click that ""t-rex DOGE start.bat"" and you should be off to the races! Make sure in the unmineable website that you click the slider to do auto-payouts at 30 DOGE if you want to set it and forget it. If you're thinking of mining other coins at some point turn this off so after you mine 30, you can stop your miner and cash out. 

Step Nine: HODL. Much mining, many money, such easy.",How to mine DOGE quickly and painlessly as possible.

I honestly think MANY will sell at a dollar causing a massive dip, and depending on how many people buy at the dip I think that Dogecoin will either recover and then have a stabilized rate of increase, or everyone just sells and recovers what they can, putting an end to Dogecoin.

I really hope we can hold and take this thing to $10, then $100, and beyond $1000!",Is May 8th judgement day for Dogecoin?

n5d9js,SxxyMonsterToTheMoon,2021-05-05 11:02:15,dogecoin,"Writing down the most important points about our beloved Dogecoin:

Dogecoin is a WORLD currency therefore comparing it to USD cash supply or market cap of a company is too small scale. We will be the market cap of several countries.

Dogecoin will reach past the 30 dollar mark for sure.

Stocks and investing in prior to IPOs are harder for regular folks but Crypto you can invest as much as you can as an early investor and make millions. Dogecoin has more potential as more and more companies support our community accepting the coin and spreading the word, this truly will become the peoples currency and it is in transitioning of getting to the value it rightly deserves. Thus point 2 is valid.

People who support the community know when they buy dogecoin they wont convert to fiat because when they ready to spend they will force the companies to accept their dogecoin or only buy things from companies who accept dogecoin.

Not everyone knows or investing in crypto so there its so much opportunity to get in now. It is still early. If you change your fiat currency to Doge it will only grow more and more, your fiat ccurrency will buy less and less. Dogecoin will be accepted more and if you are not in it you really are missing out on a transition of a century. 

I will add more as it comes to mind. Feel free to share the love and comment if you agree or disagree.",Heart to Heart with Doge. Serious opinion peice

n5dq96,FlyFallHD,2021-05-05 11:30:44,dogecoin,"I will preface this by stating that I am FULLY convinced RH is stealing from you (If you are buying any Crypto)... and they are hiding it behind bad excuses as ""server errors"" ""market malfunctions"" and so on.  


# 1. we know that on RH you do now have your own wallets.

  
Now, what does it mean to not have your own wallet, it means, that whenever you buy any crypto on RH, you give your money to RH, who then buys the crypto, and then they add it to THEIR big wallet. Then they look at the price the crypto were at when you gave them the money, and they tell you ""you have X coins that you bought at Y value""....

Therefore, you DO NOT have access to your coins, the coins belong to RH, you simply have an IOU on X amount of coins from RH.

THIS is super **important**, as this is how they steal from you in step 2.

&amp;#x200B;

# 2. They use false excuses to stop you from accessing your IOU and trade in the market when spikes occur.

As we just established, RH owns the crypto, you do not.  
Therefore, whenever you decide to sell your coins, RH just looks at the IOU they gave you, they look at how many coins you ""bought"" and at what the current price is. Then they simply give you that amount of money. They do not HAVE to sell the coins they bought with your money if they want to keep them. 

The important thing to take away here, is that the **REVERSE** is possible..

Lets say you bought 10 doge at 0,5 dollars, so currently your doge is worth **5 dollars**  
Lets say the price now is 0,6 dollars, so your 10 doge is now worth **6 dollars**

YOU earned a dollar, and now you want to cash out, IF you did sell, RH would be forced to add 6 dollars so your account - if that happens, then everything is fine.

BUT..... what if when the price spikes to 0,6 they have a ""malfunction""... then you can NOT sell, and you are forced to watch the market go either up or down... However, if RH sells the coin that they gave you an IOU for at 0,6 while you are locked out, then RH now have 6 dollars, and because ""peaks"" typically are followed by dips, the price now goes down - lets say to 0,55 - the market ""magically"" opens up again, and you sell instantly, you now sold for 0,55 and earned 5,5 dollars - meaning RH just earned ,05 dollars, that you SHOULD have had.

This example is obviously with fictive numbers, and such small amounts cant move the market, but if you look at RH in total their wallet must have hundreds of millions of coins in it - so if they sell everything or a large majority at the peak when they lock you out, not only are they preventing you from buying which would help prevent the dip, they also sell, which means they CREATE a large part of the dip. So they sell high, force the price down, watch their users panic sell when the ""problem"" ""magically"" solves itself, and then they pocket the difference.  
\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And that is how I am 100% convinced that RH is stealing from you. You may call me a tin-hat or whatever you want to, but EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. that Doge peaks their crypto capabilities go down the drain.

However, they are smart enough to not make it too obvious, so if 2 peaks happen right next to eachother, it wont happen both times. But if there is ample time between them, then you can guarantee yourself that you will be locked out.

This is why is happened when we hit 0,6 the other day, but did not happen later the same day when we hit 0,69

If you do not believe me, then take a look at RH next time the price peaks after some days of sideways trading, it will happen again, probably when we reach 1,00 or something similar.  
\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is ONE solution - CASH out NOW, then move to a different broker, a REAL broker, and buy in again.

The price of dogecoin is what people believe it is and if we believe that it can hit 10$, then it can. Don't think about how other crypto would've behaved or what the mainstream investors will do when it hits 1$. DOGE has never behaved like other crypto and neither has this community. It is so unique and one of a kind, we are making history right now!!!!. It's literally in the top 5 crypto list in the world. This will be remembered forever.

Plus over the past weeks, the adoption and utility for DOGE has skyrocketed  with many businesses accepting it, many exchanges listing it and many popular faces talking about this. FRICKING DOGEFATHER ELON is with us!!!!. How cool is that?. Sure it started as a joke but lets be honest, people are accepting it because they think there may be, there might be, maybe a small chance that this becomes big. It shows that they are starting to take this serious. And to show them that Doge can be big, we need to hodl and stay united.

n5e0y1,MediocreDoor6199,2021-05-05 11:48:31,dogecoin,"Not the first or last time I‚Äôm posting this. So there are several reasons why doge is a good prospect and the supply cap is actually one of them: it doesn‚Äôt have unlimited supply, that is a misinterpretation. It‚Äôs true that the supply increases each year for endless number of years, but it‚Äôs with a fixed number each year. Here is were it gets interesting. The CAP is MISUNDERSTOOD! Dogecoin is DEFLATIONARY!

For people who say Dogecoin is ""unlimited"" or ""permanently inflationary""

1.	‚Å†As of today there are a 130 BN coins in circulation with 5.3 BN added each year. This translates to a supply inflation of currently 3.9% per year, and it falls every year (as 5.3 bn out of for example 200 BN coins in ca 15 years is a smaller fraction right)
2.	‚Å†Over time new supply eventually would fall to an arbitrarily low value (0.0000000000001% per year, etc) but can never reach exactly 0%.
3.	‚Å†There are always coins lost due to abandoned dust and lost keys. At some point (and maybe already) these lost coins will outweigh the new supply. Therefore Dogecoin is a deflationary coin.

In other terms.

4. It. Takes. 25. Years. For. The. Circulating. Supply. To. Double. 25. The next double will take 50 years, then 100 and so on. That‚Äôs a long time. Meanwhile, ppl loosing their wallets and increased application of the currency will double value/demand a lot sooner. Value increases faster than it decreases.

For people who say Dogecoin has ""No Cap""

Dogecoin has a cap, and that cap is 10k per block. It is not like fiat which lacks a cap because the supply can be adjusted at any point. Doge's new supply is fixed eternally at 10k per block. This amounts to 3.9% supply inflation in 2021, and every year it gets lower, but it never gets to literally 0%.

This is part of the reason Doge can make it as an option for day to day payments. If you look at Bitcoin on the other hand, it has higher fees, lower transaction speed, is far more energy demanding and doesn‚Äôt get spent because people are afraid to spend away potential profits if the coin gets even more valuable. As such, Bitcoin will do good as a value holder like gold or fine art, but you won‚Äôt pay your groceries with it. For Doge it‚Äôs the other way around. Its not realistic it will go up in the thousands. However, it will easily reach a dollar and possibly ‚Äústabilize‚Äù  somewhere around 10. Here‚Äôs one calculation to support it (albeit a bit more optimistic with 15.88):

adventurous_piglet85: WHAT IS THE MAXIMUM POSSIBLE PRICE OF DOGECOIN (ANSWER PROVIDED). Written early feabruary.

So I‚Äôve seen a variation of this question asked multiple times so I went ahead and did the literal math to calculate it out. Here‚Äôs the answer: $288.6. See below.

Question(s) Is getting Dogecoin to increase to the equivalent of one US dollar possible? Can and will it really happen? What will change if it does happen? How high can Dogecoin realistically rise in price. Market cap explanation and comparison to US currency and global FIAT currency. Yes, despite not having a fixed or capped supply, the value of the currency can rise based on its relative value against other currencies in the market. You can find examples of this in the FOREX market where currency pairs are traded, like Euro against US dollar, or US Dollar against Japanese Yen. As the value of Dogecoin rises, more and more businesses will recognise its potential and importance, and subsequently begin to accept it in exchange for goods and services. This will also help to grow the developer community around Dogecoin.

Market cap = price x supply. Price is determined by supply and demand (buying and selling of Dogecoin how much people are willing to) Supply is determined by mining Dogecoin. These two numbers can change based on market conditions. However the supply is fixed and increasing at a rate of 5,000,000,000 (approximately) per year. Current supply of Dogecoin is 128,000,000,000 (128 billion). For purposes of this explanation the rate of increase is negligible.

The current market cap of Dogecoin while writing this article is 9,000,000,000 (9 billion) if Dogecoin was to reach $1 it would have a market cap of 128 billion dollars. Bitcoin (the most successful cryptocurrency$ currently has a market cap of approximately 700,000,000 (700 billion dollars). This means that at $1 the total supply of Dogecoin would be ‚Äúworth‚Äù about 1/7th of Bitcoins total supply. The estimated supply of the US dollar is 2,000,000,000 (2 trillion) since 1 dollar = 1 dollar (LOLZ) the market cap of the US currency is 2 trillion. If Dogecoin were to reach this market cap - the price can be calculated through dividing the market cap (2 trillion) by the supply (128 billion). This means that dogecoin would equal the entire US currency at $15.60. This is definitely not impossible but highly highly improbable to ever reach this value any time soon. As in like 3-10 years away minimum. Now the entire supply of the entire worlds fiat currency is 37 trillion dollars. You can apply the same logic from above and see that the value would be $288.6. This is the theoretical limit to how much Dogecoin can be worth due simply to the fact that if it was valued at anymore than that amount it would be ‚Äúworth‚Äù more than the entire world‚Äôs currencies combined which is not possible without adding more supply.",If you‚Äôre new to Doge and are skeptical about the cap.

I had a thought this morning driving into work and watch the sunrise on a beautiful morning. I read recently haters talking about how memes die with time.

It occurred to me that yes some memes die out but other memes reach a point of immortality and comfort food status. The memes you have seen forever and keep seeing that make you feel as good as when mom makes you some Mac and cheese and sweet tea. Shut up and take my money or kid giving thumbs up at internet.

Dogecoin I believe will live on in meme immortality. Why? Because it makes you feel good like cheeseburgers on the grill and a cold pop on a summer day after you just got done spending a day at the lake fishing with good friends.

 Seeing people rally around a joke coin, ignoring their differences just because ""cute dog currency go up"".

Nobody actually seems to take this seriously as something that could potentially revolutionise the world economy. 

Spread the good word of where and how to use your dogecoin instead of promoting a cash out milestone for everyone to think about. 

If the minds of everyone are focused on making it a future currency, it will eventually reach that status. 

If however the minds of everyone involved are on a price milestone all anyone will think about is how much they can earn and when they should withdraw any potential gains.

&amp;#x200B;

Yes I know... How dare I!?

Today I want to create a new dogecash masternode and need to stake 5000 dogecash. 

I don't know why, but I sent 5000 dogecoins to my private dogecash wallet-address DPGmTHr8oqtt9scdbMHhpqG2AtEMZRrump

Now my 5k dogecoins are in the dogecoin wallet with the address same as my dogecash address DPGmTHr8oqtt9scdbMHhpqG2AtEMZRrump

Fact Dogecoin has consistently logged a 7x on bitcoins growth. 
Fact Dogecoin has consistently out performed expectations. 
Fact Dogecoin is growing in use as a currency. 
Fact Dogecoin is global
Fact Dogecoin has low barrier to entry (price and technologically)
Fact Dogecoin (like all other equities) is a hedge against inflation. 
Fact USG spending will cause incredible inflation in the coming months (hyperinflation is a definite possibility) 

I say by 9/30 we see $100/per coin. 

It took Bitcoin 7 months to go from .09 to .70 &amp; 26 months to go from .70 to 100.00 (usd). 

Even using the basic 7x kicker and rounding up from 3.7 to 4 months you see it has the potential to be a $100 coin by September.

That is not far off in fact I believe it could surpass that once inflation starts accelerating. 

Right now spenders and holders have a symbiotic relationship building Dogecoin value. 

At some point that relationship will convert to combative. If holders win prices will skyrocket defeating its potential as a currency replacement. If we can reach an equilibrium of ~$1000 per coin then both sides should be pretty happy. 

Yes I want the value to blow BTC out of the water, but I also want to see if used to transact business. I am a Patriot and I am not hoping for a US Economic collapse. I believe a strong economy will be fueled by national adoption of alt currency and will take us to the next level.

n5futv,alchemical-element,2021-05-05 13:24:50,dogecoin,"  

Good afternoon, friends! 20 days ago, I published a post where I told how in the spring of 2020 I sold my 750000 doge. Like many people who found themselves in a similar situation after the incredible growth of doge this year, I was depressed about the missed opportunities... Still, now those investments would turn into $ 500,000, which would greatly affect the life of almost any person. All the more disappointing when you fell in love and started buying this coin back in 2017 and as a result did not participate in its long-awaited takeoff)

However, I have now regained my composure. I don't worry about these events anymore. I try not to blame myself. After all, I can do what has been profitable for me for many years of my life - create art. And maybe someone who was more successful than me in saving investments, and even more so real doge-millionaires will want to participate in this process? If I had kept the investment, I would have participated, because the doge has a very beautiful symbol - the Shiba Inu. To pay tribute to your luck, to capture it in a material object, isn't that great!? I think it's worth your attention...

Therefore, I offer you the custom-made Shiba Inu sculptures made by a professional sculptor - of any size, in any material (bronze, polymer, etc.), according to your photos, sketches or my projects. Delivery to anywhere in the world! Doge will be used for payment - and what else?.. I want to become a part of the family again) Write in a personal account, it will be very interesting to work!

Good afternoon, friends! 20 days ago, I published a post where I told how in the spring of 2020 I sold my 750000 doge. Like many people who found themselves in a similar situation after the incredible growth of doge this year, I was depressed about the missed opportunities... Still, now those investments would turn into $ 500,000, which would greatly affect the life of almost any person. All the more disappointing when you fell in love and started buying this coin back in 2017 and as a result did not participate in its long-awaited takeoff)

However, I have now regained my composure. I don't worry about these events anymore. After all, I can do what has been profitable for me for many years of my life - create art. And maybe someone who was more successful than me in saving investments, and even more so real doge-millionaires will want to participate in this process? If I had kept the investment, I would have participated, because the doge has a very beautiful symbol - the Shiba Inu. To pay tribute to your luck, to capture it in a material object, isn't that great!? I think it's worth your attention...

Therefore, I offer you the custom-made Shiba Inu sculptures made by a professional sculptor - of any size, in any material (bronze, polymer, etc.), according to your photos, sketches or my projects. Delivery to anywhere in the world! Doge will be used for payment - and what else?.. I want to become a part of the family again) Write in a personal account, it will be very interesting to work!

Based on the current amount of US currency in circulation (21T) and the amount of available DOGE (127M) that would make a direct value for value of ~$21,000 per DOGE.

Feeling pretty down in the dumps this morning.
I've been trying to keep my head up lately but it's hard to do at times. I know everyone has had it rough over the last year due to the pandemic, and I have too.
I had to quit my job right before the pandemic started due to a massive herniated disc in my lower back.
I was supposed to have surgery in February of 2020 and then go to Alaska to work for a few months, but because of Covid it was postponed and didn't end up going. I didn't have the surgery until a few months later in June. Come September they found a fluid build up in my spine and had to cut me open again, redo the last surgery, and remove the fluid. A few months of physical therapy, and then in January of 2021 I needed surgery again (another fluid build up). This time I awake with loss of motor function in my right foot/ankle. 
This entire time I've been without an income except for the stimulus. No unemployment, no disability, NOTHING. I've been waiting for the social security office to open up and who knows when that will be.
So, once I heard about Doge I thought maybe this would give me a break about stressing. I invested my last $93 into it and I wish I jumped on the bandwagon sooner. All I've done is turn it into $180. 
For the first time in many years I tried reaching out to god last night and I feel I'm not getting a sign.
Everytime I have needed him the most in life, he hasn't been there. I'm feeling quite hopeless and I don't know what to do. I'm on my knees here just begging for a sign that everything will get better. Please keep me in your prayers. I could really use it. ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è",Keep me in your prayers please.

n5gjt0,ExcellentHamster1296,2021-05-05 13:58:27,dogecoin,"Hello reddit. 

Here I'll explain why I think it's smart to hold a dogecoin, no matter what counter arguments you might bring me. 

Apart from the ideology that is made around this corner, namely that the lack of project has allowed the community to choose which one will be his, the basic honesty of its developers and the fact that one of the first rule of financial investment is that we observe the hype rather than our opinion, i.e. if the world is suddenly interested in an object that I think is useless, it's not stupid to buy it before everyone else, even if I don't like it, because it will be easy for me to resell it. .. But this is not the reason that pushes me to buy dogecoin. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is not an investment advice and concerns only me, as vision, and what I intended to share with you. 

Blaise Pascal, had made a bet and here, I see it. applied perfectly 

I don't know where the dogecoin will go, but I am a slave and I will be all my life if the fear of believing in dogecoin holds back investing in them. 

I don't know if the dogecoin will go up, or down, but I have the certainty of owning nothing, no car. 

&amp;#x200B;

Who can know what will happen tomorrow? I do not consider what I have lost what I have not gained, on the other hand, I think that it is criminal to hold back from believing in everything, for fear of being deceived. 

Blaise Pascal explained to us why it was intelligent to believe in God, that's his point of view (I don't believe in it, but I'm sure Pascal was a genius), well my point of view is that at the moment I'm not living, and that the dogecoin represents the opportunity to win what Blaise Pascal expresses in his bet as the infinite, the life. 

Today, I am at 0 and I do not fear to lose, I can only gain something (at least the experience), and at worst, I would stay where I am. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I have always been a man for whom money had no value, and I have always been financially poor, I hold a ridiculous amount of dogecoin and this will probably not allow me to change at least things will go despite the idea that I have money, I do not really live without. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then, trading is for me like a sport discipline, we do not send an amateur to fight a world champion by betting all our savings on him, and here, you have the right to bet only on yourself, I do not think to become independent thanks to the dogecoin corner, but I have a chance to earn money to invest. And I'm not afraid to take hits, because you don't become good by refusing complicated matches, I don't want to be a fake and a coward who avoids the fighters who make him tremble, I want to grow. 

I accept to be an amateur for a few years before hoping to bring back medals, and as everywhere those who arrive pass for arrogant before becoming obvious, references, which themselves aging will be then, one day, challenged by those whose patience to pay.

&amp;#x200B;

My personal experience is a /2 followed by a week of immobilization, before going back up and going even further than my initial bet, to get scammed, to start again, to make a /4 and to go back up in a month, before arriving even higher, and then I fell again recently, and I will surely get back up, because I will not stop trying.

&amp;#x200B;

The mistake for me is to accept to lose, by losing, I don't mean to see the victory of a match being snatched from us, I mean to leave the ring feeling heavy with shame, emptied and weakened by refusing the next fight and by the fear of the aftermath, it's to put oneself in a state of hesitation in front of the experiences that life proposes to us, to prevent oneself from believing and dreaming or from acting, by simple fear like a horse that would refuse a freedom at hand, I would even say that the mistake is to hope to have the game, the only thing that counts for me is to maintain myself the time to acquire experience and it is from this that will come my money which besides, I always laughed at myself, my parents aged and in spite of what I can think of this system, I would like at least that they do not worry any more for me.

&amp;#x200B;

All this is just Pavlov, and the only person I allow to tame me is my own name.

&amp;#x200B;

But I think it is not necessarily good to listen to the laughter of those who mock and keep the memory as the only experience.

If I retire, I will at least try to learn something more important in my life than what I would have left. 

And that something is probably not self-loathing or the bitterness of a decision.

&amp;#x200B;

In all sports, you have to know how to adapt, and if some lucky ones are mistaken for geniuses due to circumstances, often the most eloquent ones end up being the ones who originally couldn't be understood.

&amp;#x200B;

And if the deal falls through, I'll at least try to learn something more important in my life than what I would have left behind.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I don't advise you on your financial decisions, and no one but you can know what to do.

If I make a mistake, I will try to use it for the rest of my life, because the virtual is only an abstract acceleration of the physical, a projection. 

&amp;#x200B;

I order you to be well. Whether or not finance is over for us after this and whether it is due to a colossal pump or a dump that is just as colossal, we can all learn something from it that will turn this alleged mistake into a future success.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My decisions are my own, but I have been honest with reddit. 

I haven't put in more than I'm willing to lose, and that amount is for many ridiculous, I'm willing to lose everything because I have nothing. 

At least nothing material, but I have my rebellion, and my will.  (And that the most important.)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Whether you are in dodgecoin, out of dodgecoin, or not, I wish you the best and let me tell you that the real crime would be to prevent you from acting because of fears formulated by others, that they are threatening you with a missed opportunity of a lifetime, I don't know what will happen, but let me tell you, your decisions will be the right ones, even if they are your own.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know where the dogecoin will go, but I wish you the best. 

And if it doesn't go anywhere, at least I will have discovered the hope of a better life.

&amp;#x200B;

The only advice I would give you is not financial, but it is the following; Never trust anyone else more than yourself, not even me. (And if you trust someone it is because you yourself have previously judged them to be worthy, this is a proof of your confidence, so if you judge yourself to be incapable, understand that you are not at all, and then those who seek to destroy your image of yourself, do so by relying on the greatness of them) 

Best wishes for you, your hopes, and your families.  

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

No need to answer, I wanted to write it, but if you do, I will surely answer you.

&amp;#x200B;

n5gk3a,coffee-trader,2021-05-05 13:58:50,dogecoin,"I haven't met a single person who can actually give an argument about Doge being comparable to any other stablished crypto. They call it shitcoin, they say the fundamental value is zero, but I'm yet to see any substantial difference with respect to, say, ETH.

&amp;#x200B;

Isn't the fundamental value of all cryptos zero? Isn't the value of any fiat currency justified only in the monopoly of central banks in money supply? And this is, of course, if and until other currencies like crypto appear. 

&amp;#x200B;

A currency is 3 things: 1) a unit of accounting, 2) a mean to store value, 3) and a mean of exchange. It needs to have 5 properties:  1) fungible, 2) durable, 3) portable, 4) recognizable, and 5) stable. As far as I can tell, the blockchain technology in Doge is very similar to that of BTC; the fact that Doge is inflationary should make it more stable down the road because you won't have people chasing a limited supply (like BTC); and finally, the meme feature is actually a GOOD thing! How else do you get a currency to work if not by it being adopted because it's popular? 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't get why people talk about fundamental value of a currency when what it actually has to do is serve those 3 purposes and have those 5 properties -something Doge increasingly does. It's not a bond or a stock for anyone to be talking about fundamentals. I want to get you opinion, especially from the ones who are skeptical or just have Doge for a pump and dump.

If we share the website enough on Twitter or elsewhere, he almost certainly will see it.

I think Elon's plan for Saturday will undoubtably help our community and dogecoin. But I feel we can use my website to seriously convey great ideas to him for his upcoming performance, that he might not have thought of himself.

This will all end bad if the whole purpose of buying is to sell, the point is to make this a legitimate currency.

How do we do this?

Spread the word and get more stores to accept it as payment. Support the small retailers that adopted it.  Sure it's great the Mavs use it but it must go beyond that.

I'm tired of brands like Snickers and others just hopping on the bandwagon with tweets - TELL EVERYONE (NOT JUST THE BIG GUYS) YOU'LL ACTUALLY SPEND YOUR DOGECOIN IF THEY ACCEPTED IT.  The more people spend dogecoin, the more people will buy it.  

Getting rid of your dogecoin by selling in the market for profit will just destroy this currency, it has to start circulating.

If you all are scared or on here guessing remember you only lose if you sell. Buying now before $1.00 means if it runs up to $2.00 and you keep holding and it stabilizes you are okay.

The market goes up and down. A lot of people will eventually get on board but they have fear and doubt. It takes money to make money, make a calculated risk and commit.

Everyone said Bitcoin would never see the light of day. Everyone doubted crypto, now in the current climate, look at it now.

The market and coins are all a risk. But if collectively we stick together and recruit more people and ride it out, it will all work out.

The Doge has literally defied every article (almost) written to this point. Keep faith, Elon, Mark Cuban, and once Bezos jumps on board stand by.

$1.00 will be tempting to sell. Hold. $5.00 tempting to sell, HOLD. $10.00 tempting to sell. HOLD. Buy at the dips and ride it out. The hype is for this short game to prove stability. 1000 coins at $100 is 100k. Is it possible? We decide it. Flex on the haters, let them regret it.

With that being said, I am selling my eBook for 1 Dogecoin. Knowing the power of this community and wanting to do my part with regards to accepting Dogecoin, I have set up a form that will allow someone to transfer 1 Doge and in return receive a .mobi, .epub, or .pdf of my book. 

As it stands now, that equates to roughly .66 cents. I believe that $1 is just another floor and that it will go higher than that. I am not using these Dogecoins as income but as an investment. I am looking to HODL whatever Doge I end up receiving for this book.

n5gu83,matthill4,2021-05-05 14:11:44,dogecoin,"Urban Dictionary - Borker - an alternate name for a dog, particularly one that barks often or occasionally.

TLDR: https://wallet.borker.io is Twitter, except open, decentralized, borderless, permissionless, pseudonymous, immutable, and censorship-resistant. Oh, and built entirely on top of Dogecoin.

What is Borker?

https://borker.io is an application layer protocol for Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and similar UTXO-based, transparent blockchains. It relies on the openness, security, and immutability of the underlying networks and defines a method of publishing and consuming unstoppable content.

Broker-Wallet (https://github.com/borkerprotocol/borker-wallet) is a React/Typescript/WASM/PWA implementation of the Borker Protocol for Dogecoin and offers a Twitter-like experience. Users can set their profiles (name, bio, avatar). They can bork (aka tweet), re-bork, like, comment, follow, and block, just like Twitter, except that every action is actually an Op_Return transaction on the Dogecoin blockchain that gets picked up and saved by Borker Server (https://github.com/borkerprotocol/borker-server), which can be queried via standard REST API. Tipping is built into the base of the protocol, such that publishers are inherently rewarded for re-borks, likes and comments on their borks. All cryptography is done client side using a Rust library (https://github.com/borkerprotocol/borker-lib) that is compiled to WASM and imported into Borker-Wallet. Feel free to turn off your internet when generating your seed, or simply bring your own 12-word mnemonic!

In order to display balances and perform UTXO selection for all addresses, it was necessary to create a thin wrapper for Dogecoind that would maintain the entire UTXO set indexed by address. We wrote it in Rust, and we call it Superdoge: https://github.com/borkerprotocol/superdoge-rs.

Users choose their own level of sovereignty. For the total sovereign experience, a user would run the entire stack themselves. They would run their own local instance of Borker-Wallet, which would make API request to their own Borker-Server, which would fetch block data from their own Superdoge-Server, which is only a thin wrapper for their own Dogecoind Node. Dr. Bonez and I both run our own full stack and have been doing so for months without hiccup. It‚Äôs easy to set up for a developer following the READMEs on https://github.com/borkerprotocol.

While we don‚Äôt expect Borker to replace Twitter or even become widely used any time soon, we are nonetheless very proud to offer a fully-functional and truly censorship-resistant alternative. If nothing else, Borker is a proof of concept, a demonstration that the future of information sharing belongs to open, decentralized networks, and we‚Äôre happy to use Dogecoin as the backbone!",Twitter clone built entirely on top of Dogecoin!

You're holding a coin that has an unlimited supply, no use, and backs no project. It really is in a genuine bubble. 

One single address holds 28% of all dogecoins in existence, and just 12 addresses account for over 65% of all coins. 

When they want to pull the plug on this thing and take profits, what will you be left with? 

Congratulations to those who have made some decent money from dogecoin, or even better set yourself up for life. But the fact is, most of you will loose out.

Had I not run into difficulty the night I spent 5 hours trying to buy my doge, I'd be looking at a life changing situation right now. Lessons to those who hesitate.

I've never invested in anything before, but back in January I made the decision that I was gonna take the chance and put $1000 in doge. Then came Binance, and their whole process of verification, which ended up dragging on and on. I even had to go get a new license so that the photo on it was more current. By this time, doge had begun  to climb a little, and I started to get nervous about potentially losing $1000. It's mid pandemic, and I was low on cash at that point having only worked about 6 months the previous year in total, not knowing how much work is coming up, and I was in online school for training in my trade for January-February. I decided I need to wait until I get working again before I can spare the money, and in the meantime hope the price will drop down for me to get in.

1.  Adding nodes Manually
2. Opening the appropriate port on your router to your Dogecoin running machine.

They are listed elsewhere.  Someone can link to 

I am sure these helped, but ultimately what did it for me was..

1.  Help/Peers

But it bothers me, that people are not really able to mine this peoples coin. I get it, that in the beginning it was necessary to bind it to litecoin mining etc. But i think we are past that point. 

I'm a computer engineer, but no crypto/blockchain expert. But there sure must be a way to enable real community members to mine only Doge, without any ASIC's or other fancy hardware needed.

I'm not sure how to import my paper wallet from walletgenerator if i need to decrypt it first under wallet details and use the private key WIF or to just use the normal private key given by wallet generator and command line from the instruction sheet. i would also like help to know if i can encrypt the paper wallet from dogecoin core with a passphrase as well or not and how. Thank you for any replies ahead of time.",Paper wallet questions

Now, if our proud little Shibe were to lose its strong footing and crash,  there are so many people that would lose big. These same people could/would turn their backs on supporting of Tesla, SpaceX, Dallas Mavericks, etc. 

Why would these two great entrepreneurs choose to lead this following, if they didn‚Äôt positively think this could benefit their bottom lines.

I kept the hard drive of my old computer all these years ‚Äújust in case‚Äù. Saved it from my wife‚Äôs (gf at the time) spring cleaning mania every year since then. What have I tried so far? Plugging the computer hard drive with a SATA cable to my new laptop and I tried to transfer the dogecoin data folder over. Sadly, it didn‚Äôt work‚Ä¶ I fear the hard drive may be corrupted since it keeps disconnecting from my computer before the data transfer is complete (I think I was able to transfer the whole folder after multiple attempts but I may be wrong‚Ä¶). All this being said, would a simple data transfer be enough to retrieve the coins? (Computer n00b talking here with minimal experience in the domain.) a friend of mine also suggested a hard drive recovery tool. Would that be the next step?

Could I perhaps boot up the hard drive on a computer and transfer the coins from that wallet to another wallet? Or is there a simpler solution? (Wallet updates take forever‚Ä¶ esp if it goes all the way back to 2016‚Ä¶ so I‚Äôd like to avoid this if possible.)

I have no idea how many coins I have left (I mined a few and donated a few to faucets over the short time period I was active), so the reward to us all will be a nice little screenshot of my account balance.

n5hw19,chanman2087,2021-05-05 14:58:30,dogecoin,"Dogecoin is the people‚Äôs money. It‚Äôs organic, irreverent, and fun. It‚Äôs not forced on us by a government or some other central authority, it‚Äôs chosen by us, for us ‚Äî by the people, for the people. Wow.

For many, the idea of emergent money that is not mandated by fiat is hard to grok. We‚Äôre used to being told what money is. For most of our lives, paternalistic money is all we‚Äôve ever known...until Bitcoin.

Dogecoin continues Bitcoin‚Äôs tradition of giving the control of money back to the people. Yes, it‚Äôs a meme coin, but all money is a meme. And all money is both an idea and a matter of faith or belief in it. Over the multi-milennia history of money, the majority of money (be it shells, beads, precious metals, etc.) has been what we the people say it is and believe it is.

Dogecoin is the perfect vehicle to lay bare this fundamental truth about money. And in serving this purpose, DOGE has a legitimate claim to some value. It reflects the true history and nature of money. It turns the idea of money being something that‚Äôs issued by an authority ‚Äî a conceit ‚Äî on its head. They say there‚Äôs some truth in every joke. Dogecoin‚Äôs value is its punchline.
 
 
Dogecoin is as much a statement as it is a currency. A statement about the philosophy of money. The democratization of money. It‚Äôs a protest against the fact that fiat money and the centralized financial system are not level playing fields. That they are built by a few and disproportionately favor those few. That too much power rests in too few hands.

And the world is waking up to this. Nothing captured this more than the GameStop saga. We saw first-hand how the system is rigged against the individual investor and we can‚Äôt unsee this. We saw how the individual investor can be more sophisticated than the most sophisticated institutional investors. Most importantly, we saw that the individual investor is ready to demand better. We don‚Äôt believe it's a coincidence that global interest in crypto and Dogecoin spiked after individual investors were GameStopped.
 
 
No one person, organization, or authority decides the value of a crypto ‚Äì its value is determined by its supply and your demand for it. In Dogecoin‚Äôs case, its money supply is transparent, predictable, and disinflationary. The Dogecoin protocol issues a fixed amount of 5 billion DOGE every year. Over time, this fixed, annual issuance of 5 billion DOGE will represent a much smaller percentage of Dogecoin‚Äôs overall money supply. This means the growth rate of Dogecoin‚Äôs money supply is actually decreasing. In other words, Dogecoin‚Äôs money supply is disinflationary. This is not dissimilar to how Ethereum‚Äôs money supply of ether currently works. Recently, demand for Dogecoin has oustripped its supply. As a result, its price has been mooning. The people are speaking.

As the world ponders the popularity and meme-ification of a grammatically challenged dog, many are engaging in a referendum on centralized money and finance by joining the Dogecoin community. And the best part? They‚Äôre doing it with a smile. So amaze.

We‚Äôre not here to tell you what money is. We‚Äôll leave that up to you. We‚Äôre here to empower you with greater choice, independence, and opportunity.

Onward and Upward!

They lost power in the past 30 years where other, more powerful people took control. Now the USD is purposely being pushed into obsolescence *(for whatever reason, pick your conspiracy)* where a reliance on digital currencies are taking place. People are seeing the value of doge as the Biden admin keeps printing more money, more than 20% so far.

If doge ""prints"" 10k doge per minute, it is nothing compared to the amount of USD printed per minute. The exact amount is hard to narrow down because of how much money is being thrown into ""stimulus"" but it's somewhere around $200k-$400k/minute.

People are being robbed by holding onto their USD so they know that they need to invest it. Mind you that the world economies are mostly based on the USD. Doge is now becoming part of the digital family, where it may be used to buy goods, even at some ATMs!  We're becoming something bigger and perhaps this week we will even become bigger than the United States Dollar.

Binance.US is much smaller  and higher fees than Binance  
then the article named some more. 
‚ÄúBinance.US is much smaller than other exchanges. CoinGecko, a crypto metrics site, pegs Binance as the largest cryptocurrency exchange, with a daily volume of $8.2 billion. By comparison, Binance.US has a daily volume of $89 million, as of this writing, making Binance.US the smaller fish by over 90x.¬†
This also makes Binance.US far smaller than other leading US exchanges. Traders on Coinbase Pro shifted $1.7 billion in the past 24 hours; on Kraken, $774 million; and on Gemini, $97 million.‚Äù

n5ibdr,Conscious_Fennel6938,2021-05-05 15:16:39,dogecoin,"I recently studied financial modeling and was surprised to find that BROWNIAN MOTION  is sometimes used to model stocks.

Brownian motion is when you have a small particle like a grain of pollen floating in water, and you observe that it bounces around randomly because of the numerous water molecules colliding with the pollen.

Here is the thing. The more frequent the collisions occur, the more variance there is to the position of the pollen. To speak in our terms, we are like the numerous water molecules, and Dogecoin is our pollen. Buying is hitting the water molecule from one direction, and selling is hitting it from the opposite direction. The more frequent we make our transactions (or equivalently if there are more of us), the more volatile Dogecoin potentially becomes. This is in fact one of the big reasons many investors deem Dogecoin a volatile asset.

However, look at how stable Dogecoin has been these days. That means almost all of us water molecules, are pushing our Doggo in the same direction! WE MASSIVELY OUTNUMBER THOSE WHO SELLS! It's just unbelievable how steady out Doggo has been given the extremely frequent transactions happening day in and day out.

And guess who first explained Brownian Motion? It's Albert Einstein himself. Now I know these already made sense to you, but adding this layer of physics intuition makes me believe even more how united we are as a community.",Physics Say Dogecoin Will Win

I searched for hours for a solution, but I still dont know how to proceed further.

In a nutshell: couple of years ago I received a couple of K dogecoins on a paper wallet. I dont know where did I transfer it, but I have a paper with the written 12 words, plus I have also 2 passwords which I wrote 3 years ago. The problem is, that I dont know where did I wrote it, where can I use it. 

I tried already [https://iancoleman.io/](https://iancoleman.io/) webpage to generate based on the 12 words the private keys, which I imported on the [dogechain.info](https://dogechain.info) page, but the codes (they were multiple) are saying that they dont have any balance. 

Based on the paper wallet I see the public address of the original wallet, and I see also that I transferred it to another address. I assume when I registered the wallet in to [dogechain.info](https://dogechain.info) or whatever page. 

Is there any solution to find these coins?

It means that he has been making the same mistake for years and is unable to correct it.

&amp;#x200B;

Be sure that those who told us that the dogecoin could not exceed 10 cents and who are stuck at 5% profit for ten years even though they have injected millions have much less understanding of cryptocurrencies than those they spend their lives criticizing.

As for dogecoin, for me I now consider it gambling, and I try.

But I see nothing rational in my choice and I assume it, think it will crash or it will rise based on nothing verifiable. On the other hand the expectation of gains, seems to me infinitely superior to the probability of failure. And by continuing to go systematically on the side of the positive expectation, I would inevitably win on the long term according to me. (Laws of large numbers, and the principle of casinos, because if some people say that Pascal's bet doesn't work, I'm waiting for them to explain to me how casinos do it to win in the long term, the reality is that these people have understood nothing about betting and look at it from the customer's point of view, except that in reality in betting we are the ones who deal the cards, and so we are the casino).

If I take dogecoin alone it is gambling, if I take other similar experiences and agglomerate them it becomes mathematical. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is not financial advice, it is a personal point of view, and a choice that is just as personal.","Yes the dogecoin can crash, but he also can up."

n5iym2,Electrical-Lack-5030,2021-05-05 15:43:54,dogecoin,"Hello Guys,

I searched many time but looks like my case is not existed, so I make a new post.

I had some doge coin in the app calling dough wallet back in 2016, and I had to reset my phone because of getting slow. After that I tried to back up my iOS and reinstall the dough wallet app but I was not able to do it because it was removed from the app store. So on that time I said never mind and I did not search about it and just delete the app which was like on download mode but it never could do it.

After 2 years I checked the price and I was crazy about the amount.

I still have the same iPhone and old backup of the phone on my computer.

My question is:

Is it possible to have access to my dough wallet app without Recovery Phrase on the same iPhone?

I could give some of it to a person could help me to do that.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you,",lost my dough wallet app

I predict that the day of and following SNL the price will go up. It will then peak and a lot of people will sell to cash out out on the new price. This will create a dip where broke shibes can buy coin on sale. The coin will balance back out in a few days with a floor between .30 and .60 but continue to climb steadily.

So...

1) Paper hands will be here, but don't get mad at them.

2)If you want to buy on sale, there might be another sale about to happen.

Now then, if you want the price to go up, it is pretty simple. The only way to influence pricing is to affect liquidity. If there are many doge available for purchase, then the price goes down. If there are only a few left, the price will go up. The only way to keep the price going up, is to regularly remove doge from the market: aka, continue buying doge.

It is great to see this support from everyone here, but if you want the price of doge to continue to go up, you need to be purchasing it every day. It doesn't have to be large amounts, but some amount of doge getting purchased is going to impact the price more than just checking our balances. :D",[Serious] How to influence pricing

1.  Why do we link Elon Musk‚Äôs actions to the success of Doge?  Personally, I really like the guy - his innovations with SpaceX are fantastic and something that the space program needs.  My issue is that while he is a great guy, he is a rocket man not a finance/crypto guy.  Do we really want to peg Doge‚Äôs success to basically an influencer?

2. Doge getting listed on other platforms.  This is very good.  We should see continued growth when Gemini opens up trading and when Coinbase lists Doge.  I hope the additional listings will promote stability.

3.  Will Doge gain general acceptance?  Doge is becoming a household name and is being accepted at more places.   General Acceptance remains to be seen - many finance pundits dismiss Doge.

4.  Is the no-cap limit a problem?  It may keep value on the low side but certainly will keep it accessible to a very large group of people.

Elon asked for feedback and we know what he got, we know his digital name and his toys names. (His been kicking about a few but I think we got a name for him now). We know bitcoin announced support for doge and the investors and founders exchanged messages publicly. We know know a few handful of companies dominate social media and we know who the owners are and what their interests are and who they usually hang up with. We also know some of them have futuristic profile pictures. We also know social media allow interactions between each other. Who we really don't understand is the value investor (anyone cares?) But, we know what we are doing on Saturday. 

Please comment if you think this helps the dogecommunity. Hate to see anyone losing since we've had sooooo much fun. We gonna get people who got in .50s so proud! Armey will double soon. The space is growing very fast. üëâNO FINANCIAL ADVICE.üëà

n5jiya,SadDude01,2021-05-05 16:07:20,dogecoin,"OK, This is the truth, last year, I bought around 100 USDs ( i cant remember exactly how much ) worth of Dogecoin, and sold them for a $51 Amazon giftard, and now the same price of those dogecoins is around $10k. I am not a rich guy, and that is why, the thought of all this is haunting me night and day. I dont have a job, neither am I any youtuber. Now I am in Canada, but, I actually immigrated from India. In India, there are many many dogs on the streets, and , I used to take my parents money, and used to buy food for those doggos. It made me feel happy. Now, I am begging those doggos ( literally ) to bless me wwith dogecoins, the reason is, I believe in the fact that a dog is more important that a human being, because he can't express his feelings in a verbal way, but , he has a straight up connection to God. Any plea for help from a doggo goes a long way. I have a labrador, who is alive, and in India. I used to have this street dog-taken home and named him Robo. He died last year, while I was not here, and I miss him.

All I am asking is, would you be kind enough to send me any amount of dogecoin ( Which I am obviously going to hodl, not sell it off like I did ) . I promise you, these funds will be used to support my community of Doggos, back home, I am going to used 50% of this on Dogs in my state in India. And if I don't. God is in front of me. May I shall perish badly if I don't spend %50 of all funds that I may get from you on Doggos in my state, who are roaming around here and there without any life. I have hal my family in India, and if I can get enough dogecoins to kickstart a DoggoSaving Non-Govermental Organistaion, it would be great.",I need coins please

Big long-term gains are not nearly as important of a talking point as ""how do we get vendors/markets/businesses to accept DOGE"" so the coin will facilitate more trade, and grow organically from a real use case.  
For $10 to happen there would have to be a [market cap of \~1.29 trillion](https://www.express.co.uk/finance/city/1425084/dogecoin-price-prediction-when-will-doge-reach-10-USD-latest-forecast-evg). For $100 to happen, the cap would be nearly equivalent to the China's entire GDP. These are hypothetical outcomes so far in the future that talk of either is just a distraction from ""how do we make DOGE the best crypto for regular commerce."" This is how we actually get DOGE to hodl onto the momentum it has gained so rapidly.  
TL;DR - Hyping each other up in a subreddit does not show people \*outside\* this community any practical worth of the coin. Our efforts would be much better spent towards getting vendors to accept DOGE as payment instead of speculating on future gains.","Can we stop with the $100, $1000 and $10000 'goal' talk?

Now I'm starting to hate past me because had I just invested then I would have approximately quadrupled my money. Buying now when it's at an all time high seems stupid, but not buying when it's surging so much, especially ahead of Elon Musk's SNL show also seems stupid. I heard from one news source that it is possible it could hit $5 by the end of 2021, but it's more likely to plummet to $0.10. I'm not going to invest more than I can afford to lose, but if I bought hoping for it to hit $5 so I could make lots of profit only for it to go down to 10 cents, it would be quite unfortunate.

Since Elon Muskateer is hosting SNL, I have a skit idea that will never see the light of day. 

[Opening scene: Elon is driving in a Tesla Truck somewhere in the US]

WHOOOP [police siren indicates Elon is getting pulled over]

[Elon pulls truck over as the Tesla Truck makes some weird Easter egg noise]

[Officer Jenkins approaches the driver window]
""Sir do you know wh- OH MY GOD! It's... It's E-e-Elon m-m-m-musk...""

[Elon] *chuckles* ""I know, no need to get star stru..""

[Officer Jenkins] ""SIR! CALM DOWN!"" [Jenkins whispers into radio] ""This is Officer Jenkins, I've got a code 420-69... I repeate, a 420-69... that's right! I've got a white african american... yes! YES! a HWHITE AFRICAN AMERICAN!!"" 

[Elon] ""Well I hardly think that's import..""

[Jenkins cuts him off] ""SIR PLEASE STAY CALM.I AM UNSURE TO FEAR FOR MY LIFE OR LET YOU GO WITHOUT A WARNING! I AM SLIGHTLY CONFUSED AND BAD THINGS CAN HAPPEN TO YOU WHEN I AM CONFUSED!""

[Elon, trying to calm the officer] ""It's fine, officer, I was just checking my DOGE cult, I mean coin, and realized too late I was speeding. If you just give me the tick..""

[Jenkins] ""SIR! WHAT DID I JUST SAY!?""

[Radio cackles] ""Officer Jenkins, please respond""

[Jenkins] ""This is Jenkins""

[Radio] ""say again, you have a HWHITE African American Male... say again, you have a codev420-69?""

[Jenkins] ""That's Affirmative! Need officer needs assistance!""

[Radio] ""JESUS FRYCOOKING CHRIST! ALL AVAILABLE UNITS, OFFICER NEEDS ASSISTANCE AT Swag blvd, block 5-8-0-0-8, across from the intersection of Send and NOODZ, ALL AVAILABLE UNITS RESPOND IMMEDIATELY!""

[Elon, visibly concerned] ""what the... it was just a minor traff-""

[Jenkins draw out an obvious Firearm] ""SIR! SHUT YOUR FLIPPIN MOUTH BEFORE I TAZE YOU!"" 

[Other officers arrive on set]""JENKINS! THAT'S YOUR SERVICE WEAPON!""

[Jenkins realizes it is indeed NOT a taser and holsters gun and draws actual taser] 

[Jenkins]""Oh, sorry about that. Ha, I keep forgetting it's on the other side""

[Elon, getting slightly relaxed] ""Whew, for a second there I thou... ""

[Jenkins] "" SHUT THE F&amp;*K UP... SIR! IF YOU WERENT A CODE 420-69, I WOULD HAVE ALREADY SHOT YOU IN THE FACE AND ALL OF YOUR DOGS IN YOUR VEHICLE!!!""

[Elon, confused] ""Dogs??? OH! You mean my DOGECOINS!"" 

[Elon puls out a few over-sized DOGE COINS] ""I've got Space X, but these bad bois are gonna take me TO THE MOON""

Looking forward to 9th of May when Saturday Night     Live  is  done and the DOGE  domino effect kicks in. 100 billion  market    cap   (soon-ish) will make a  few very rich, almost everybody  else  poor   and   regulators will jump in to  ""protect"" the  Dogetards&amp;co  and   everybody   else owning crypto. For  your own  good :), right? Now  you want to deal   with smart contracts?  Great,  connect your crypto  wallet   with your  bank  account, for your own   protection... Anything  else,   lets  over-regulate  that too. DOGE is  all  fun and games until  it   isn't...

When     you buy ETH,  or ADA in the near future, or enter your coin here,  you  buy it to    HODL&amp;stake or use it for smart contracts, DEX,  DAOs,   voting&amp;governance. To pay transaction fees for something  useful.   99.99% of DOGE topics in their subreddit are about getting  rich and       0.01% about anything else (if there's such a thing when  it comes to       doge).

I have recently been doing some personal research into the environmental impacts of cryptocurrencies, particularly those using proof-of-work blockchains. I was wondering if anyone knowledgeable on the subject could help point me towards some resources to calculate statistics similar to the ones on [Digiconomist](https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption/), but for Dogecoin. Sustainability is pretty important to me, and since Dogecoin is based on the Bitcoin blockchain (technically LiteCoin but the differences are minimal), I imagine it‚Äôs not that great for the environment. Especially with Dogecoin becoming more popular lately (I remember way back when they were fractions of a cent and people paid each other in Dogecoin on Reddit to be silly), I assume it‚Äôs just going to get worse.

On this day in 2014: Josh Wise, the driver of the Dogecoin racecar, did an AMA on the subreddit /r/IAmA. Check it out here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24tq3t/i\_am\_josh\_wise\_the\_driver\_of\_the\_dogecoin\_no98/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24tq3t/i_am_josh_wise_the_driver_of_the_dogecoin_no98/)

&amp;#x200B;

Dogecoin got a huge influx of users that day, in large part to the AMA's popularity. New users were welcomed into a related thread on /r/dogecoin where they could receive tips. Shibes were tipping 100√ê at a time! Dogecoin was worth $0.00045 USD at the time, and only available on a few exchanges like Kraken, most of the others now defunct. See the thread here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/24tltu/welcome\_riama\_we\_cant\_tip\_you\_in\_your\_sub\_but\_we/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/24tltu/welcome_riama_we_cant_tip_you_in_your_sub_but_we/)

n5jw9t,brooklyn_nn,2021-05-05 16:22:40,dogecoin,,"Dips are just normal ;) it will grow again, just look at the charts from the last days... Dips -grows, dips again - more grow"
n5jwdk,Rockybing,2021-05-05 16:22:48,dogecoin,"Let‚Äôs be honest a 20% drop for most things is a HUGE dip. Doge isn‚Äôt most things. It‚Äôs up ~100% in the last week. So 20% dip is a normal correction. 

Why does a big dip happen after a big run? Well people hit their numbers. People got a return they are satisfied with and are selling some. That‚Äôs ok people deserve their returns, I‚Äôm happy for them. But when you see it going back up that‚Äôs a new stronger price. Why? Well more people bought in at .60 then. Which means they are in with a new higher target than the people who just sold. Everyone‚Äôs target is different and now that goal target is higher. (Everyone‚Äôs target is usually a round number too which is why we will most likely see a sell off at $1). 

Don‚Äôt listen to the ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs on sale buy now‚Äù. Put it what you can afford to lose when you can regardless of the price. Then you can avoid fomo and being annoyed you bought at the wrong time. No one knows the right time to buy, not even Elon. And if you aren‚Äôt ready to lose it all you‚Äôll be a ‚Äúpaper hand‚Äù and sell at the wrong time. And if you aren‚Äôt ready to lose it all, crypto, and especially doge, isn‚Äôt for you. And that‚Äôs ok! 

We all truly believe we can look up on Christmas Day this year and see Doge at $2. Maybe even more, maybe less. But this is the journey. Big dips after bigger gains. The way is to HODL. It‚Äôs not easy to hold on to a rocket as it goes to the moon, but it‚Äôll be worth it.",How to look at massive dips

Going mainstream

community is growing

Trending daily

Brands are accepting it as payment

Exchanges are listing it ( it jumped on 5/4/2021 because eToro and Gemini added Dogecoin to sell and trade.

Dogecoin is widely known now.

Banks are now looking at adding crypto wallets because of this.

Jeff Bezos is going to be listing crypto wallets as ways to take payments which means DOGECOIN will be viable

USA government is now wanting to step in and tax the cryptomarket and try to put a handle on it.

This is a movement now, and we are taken seriously. DO NOT BE A PANSY AND SELL THIS IS SIMPLY A DIP, NOT A CRASH.

Historically in the past, Dogecoin jumps then settles on its new floor, then jumps again. STOP FLIPPING OUT, AND FRAKING BUY THE DIP!!!",PLEASE READ THIS IT HELPS SETTLE YOU!!

The question seems to have obvious answers, like ""to grow my money!"" or ""to be wealthy!"" If we could avoid those answers just for this topic.

- Do you invest to protect your future, so you can retire comfortably?
- Do you want to make sure you have the money to pay for your child's education?
- Do you want to prepare for possible sickness and hospital bills when you are old?

- Do you just want to escape the rat race and have the option to do what you want to do?

Don't get me wrong, DOGE is the first coin I ever bought and I love it, it introduced me to this beautiful world of crypto and I've learnt so much because of DOGE but according to me DOGE isn't a good long term investment, it's great to see that a few people including me have made some money with it.

I'm a noobie, wow-lmao, and just installed Easyminer and loaded mining Litecoin in a Moneymaker mode. I still don't know if it's better to use Moneymaker mode (then - trading Litecoins for some Doges) instead of str8 Doge mining but some questions appeared:

* When checked numbers through Mining Calculators, I understood that 744 kHs is a very small speed for GTX 1660 Ti and i7-10750H. Does Easyminer show it right, if the amount of blocks seems good?

[1.3 h, 176 shares, 171 blocks, speed ???](https://preview.redd.it/60qa7ibd0cx61.png?width=717&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe49918ade5d57f3d853bbc26d3c052ce69eec25)

* Would it be better to use straight mining of Dogecoin if I want to owe them? Are there any other reasons except transaction fees and the size of a pool?
* Isn't it a so bad idea to mine on the Asus laptop (ROG Strix G17)?

HODL #1 Buys 100 doge @ 10cents.  (avg 0.10 per doge) $10 invested

HODL #2 Buys 1000 doge @ $1 (avg $1 per doge) $1000 invested

Doge goes to $2

HODL #1 Doge is worth $200 (100X$2) = Made $190.00

HODL #2 Doge is worth $2000 (1000X$2) = Made $1000

\#1 is only increasing $100 for each $1 increase.  #2 is increasing $1000 per 1$ increase. It matters how much Doge you own, not the avg cost per Doge. Buy and HODL.  When it goes up you profit based on the quantity of Doge you own.  üöÄüöÄüöÄüíéüíéüíéüôåüôåüôå",Explanation for people worrying about averaging up.

Doge is mooning, and for and old head like myself it‚Äôs good to see the community get the recognition that we always knew would happen eventually.  In full transparency; I sold my ~500k Doge back in ‚Äò18 to help fund an urgent vet bill, and I have zero regrets. 

When I saw it hit ¬¢.40 a few weeks ago I was hit with immense ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe I sold my Doge!!‚Äù feeling, but I was reminded by the fact that the sale helped keep my ‚Äúgood boye‚Äù healthy and with me a bit longer. This past weekend I lost that good boye to cancer...we knew it was coming, and were thankful to have him an extra 9 months due in part to a remarkable breakthrough  canine cancer vaccine trial based out of Yale University.

A lot of you Shibes have come into an amazing windfall with Doges success, and I suggest that maybe as a community we can do a little to make the world a better place the way the Doge community has always done, and help fund research into finding a cure for canine cancer. Similar to the GME ‚ÄúApes‚Äù that funded and adopted gorillas.

Dr. Mark Mamula and his team at Yale work on donations, and each vaccine trial helps their team get closer to learning how to DEFEAT cancer in our furry friends.  We firmly believe that because of this vaccine, we were able to give our goodest boy 9 more months of love and life while he fought osteosarcoma. Each participant is asked to donate $1200 to the program, I would pay it again in a heartbeat and my wife and I plan on providing an annual donation to Dr. Mamula and his team for everything they did for us.

Shibes, is you find it in your heart to spread the love I would suggest helping his team and funding their cause! Let‚Äôs help keep the bestest of boyes with their humans.

let‚Äôs make Elon proud by putting doge right next to tesla where it belongs.

doge to $1000.

I would gamble with money I didn't really have, and was prone to panic selling at the drop of a hat. I was chasing fads and not bothering with DD or even basic research. I sucked, and I paid the price repeatedly.

Dogecoin is the first asset that I have truly believed in. I found this community, and the enthusiasm was so infectious that it made me want to be a better hodler. Or a hodler for the first time, really. I did some research. I bought in at .37, and then afterwards bought the dip to lower my cost basis. In the following weeks, it has been fun to watch our coins appreciate, but something is different for me.

Now, whenever the dip comes back, I am calm. I don't feel that sense of desperation and panic, screaming at me to sell for a loss to avoid losing everything. I just don't worry about it. If anything, dips just make me more motivated to find funds to buy more Dogecoin. I trust the community and like the coin *that much*. For me, this is an opportunity that I actually believe in, and **I AM NOT SELLING**.

Last night (US here), when my portfolio was up almost double, I wasn't seriously tempted (just a little, because I am human) to cash out, because I am certain that we're nowhere near the end of the journey.

This coin is going to stay. The internet won't let a good joke die, and Dogecoin isn't even a joke anymore. It's real. It isn't going anywhere, and neither am I. Thank you all for helping me grow from a true paper hand to something a little better: as believer.",Perspective on price fluctuations

I'll share my honest opinion about Mr Musks moderation on SNL

I think, he will reveal that he has much more to do with Dogecoin than we all think he is.. Maybe he really owns some sharings of it.. Who knows? He's supporting it since many time back.

Of course Mr Musk is not a boring person, so I guess he would make this whole reveal as a skit.. Because why? It is SNL and it stands for that, this is what people wanna see.. And! Because ""doge is a joke, it's only a meme"", after this skit I think it wouldn't be far away for thinking about a ""special bonus"" like he would tell us (seriously) that there will be a limit for Doge

Everyone would win in this situation, he'd make himself fkn popular and spread Doge wider, making profit and he WILL DEFINITELY TAKE DOGE TO THE MOON he could bring it to every place as a payment with his connections and his powerful mind..","My true thought about May, 8"

  My question is, other than being fun to invest in and having a cool icon, is this coin going to have a sustainable market growth? Can it keep growing long term and make something of itself? Or will it remain a joke coin and something that is just fun to have money in? Idk if im framing up question correctly.

I think they are a lot of people like me who would like the coin to really hit high values to get rich.

But lets be real here, if we want to get the coin to 10 $ we would need a market capital even larger than the oen of bitcoin. (which is at least possible).

To get to 100 $ or even 1000$ would mean that we get a least a market capital 10 or 100 X the one of bitcoin.

At nights I squint hard at the moon and I like to imagine that I can see the rocket already in orbit. Though I once held a huge hoard of coin, in my haste to extract my prize from Robinhood (as I had heard that you do not truly ""own"" any cryptocurrency on the platform), I failed to do my research and scout a proper point of re-entry. As someone not savvy to the ways of crypto, little did I know at the time that setting up a true wallet would take a week of downloading and that purchasing coins would not be a simple transaction; while I waited for space-TSA to clear me for take-off, the rocket launched, and I was left stranded with my suitcase. Now my voyage to the stars is naught but a distant dream as I return to everyday toil. But that's life, and all I can do now is wish you lunar puppers well on your journey.

n5lsmu,SignificantAd5680,2021-05-05 17:41:41,dogecoin,"So as some of you know, the original doge meme is based on a 15 year old shiba that‚Äôs still very much alive. The meme is obviously extremely popular and definitely one of the most wide spread memes of our time with a wide variety of sub-memes based on it (bonk the horny away and Swole doge as examples). Eventually, the original shiba will pass away (relatively soon if we‚Äôre looking at lifespan averages) which is IMO a very important factor to consider. First, the internet‚Äôs response needs to be taken into account. The news of doge‚Äôs passing (RIP) will spread like wildfire throughout the internet with many tributes and ESPECIALLY memes being put out with insane records. This is important as it also brings major attention to dogecoin during this time. Second, as the doggo is fairly old, if it passes away relatively soon it will perfectly coincide with this huge spike that dogecoin has been riding to the moon recently. This extra push may be what sends the crypto sky rocketing. Think of how a piece of art work can more than triple in price if the artist were to die.

the big problem I see for the coin is acceptance as a viable instrument of payment. I feel like the future will be more liquid and flow because assets can be immediately redistributed when they are not in use to other areas without affecting the pool.   


I have several visions in my mind of how this could work with crypto and the need for diverse currencies as we continue to develop the IoT. i just view the future as something rapidly changing and free from as much financial restrictions.

n5m7f3,raresanevoice,2021-05-05 17:58:50,dogecoin,"First, the community. how many people own more than 5 bitcoins? How many own more than 1,000 doge? Hell... almost 1.7 million members on this sub.

secondly... scale. Yeah, today's dips were large 10% or so but zoom out to a week. 100% growth in a week.  1000% in 1 month.  16,000% in a year. This is a correction. People, including whales, are taking some profit right now. It's a good time to load up because we're seeing a nice floor around the 50 to 60 range. Averaging up is worth it if it helps the coin grow and bring you greater profit.

Thirdly, more vendors are accepting Doge. Newegg accepts doge. So do major sports teams like the Mavericks. Oakland As just shared that they are selling tickets for doge. Budweiser is having a photo contest for best Bud-Doge. Slim Jim and Snickers are on the bandwagon and tweeting Elon about Doge. Pornhub lets you get your freak on while supporting Doge.

Merchants and providers from dentists to pest control to etsy creators to Sweden's largest taxi company: accepting Doge.

Fourth: it's based on a meme which means it's viral. Doge is a currency and that requires larger utilization to grow. What's better for growing in awareness than a meme, especially one based on a Shibu. It's very creation as a joke, is part of what makes it approachable.

Fifth is related. Awareness/ Celebrity endorsements, etc. Elon Musk and Mark Cuban fighting to be known as the head of Doge. Musk and his SNL appearance in a few days. But not just them. Snoop dogg supporting it. Ellen tweeting about it. I don't sport, but Meek is apparently an athlete who dropped a bunch of money in Doge because he 'was tired of missing out.' Attention is growing and as it grows, our community grows.

Sixth. Increased markets. eToro added Doge on monday which brought our not so little Shibu to over a billion new possible customers in India. According to eToro, over 8.3% of their customers bought doge, all on monday night. over 150k new Shibus signing up. None, as of monday evening, had placed sell orders. Gemini is trading doge now and released a market analysis admitting they were wrong to ignore it.

Lastly, our shibu is something everyone can appreciate. Bit Coin is one of those fancy gold foil laced truffle appetizers that barely fits a tea-spoon while Doge is ramen. Everyone can afford raman. That approachability makes it more easily adopted by more people. the very anger that the elites of the crypto community throw at doge show WHY we need a common person's coin. the more they insult our doge and dream about it failing, the more i buy.

If you're having heart murmurs looking at the day chart, zoom out, and walk away for a minute. HODL or read the FAQ. Learn more about why our Shibu is so awesome and ignore the dip. Or better yet, buy the dip and enjoy some chips.",Why I'm not worried about the small dip/ correction

Here we are in the rocket, well into blast off, but where are we going?  What is the price that Doge coin can even reach?  Lets do away with speculation and get the real answer as to what is the price Dogecoin can reach.  Top scientific and mathematical minds have collaborated with leading economists to find out.  An deep data analysis was conducted using the latest in predictive AI modeling with next gen machine learning.  After thousands of computational hours the team has come to a unanimous consensus.  These numbers were vetted through a double blind peer review and the math was found to be correct.  We can now know going forward for a scientific mathematically vetted fact that 1 Doge = 1 Doge",What Math and Science tells us about the future price of Dogecoin

I believe the developers themselves said that they aren't opposed to the idea, the only problem is that if they did, they'd need to figure out how to stop hackers or something like that. But if someone could figure out that issue for them, then they would do it. If they did, I feel like Dogecoin would skyrocket like bitcoin did. I mean it's already out pacing it this year percent % wise without a cap. So that means a lot of people must be buying! So imagine a cap. You already have famous people like Elon backing it. If we could petition to get him to help them do whatever it is they need to do to put a cap on it, then we could see some huge growth I think. I mean someone like Elon would have the resources right?

How could he possibly know if I could 'lose a lot of money'.   He doesn't know me nor how much I have invested.  If I have not invested 'a lot of money' in DOGE, I can't lose 'a lot of money'.

Does any of our enlightened ones anticipate the coin having a cap be put on it? Basic economics would indicate supply and demand but within infinite amount of coin circulating, the value will not reach the potential of BTC I would think

Even though the Fed is printing money and it goes brr, they can always pull and call back that money to prevent further dilution of the dollar.

However, in the week or so I am going to be receiving around 0.59 BTC due to some BTC staking with my buddies from Stake and F2Pool that started about a year ago which due to the increase is now valued around $34,000. Now that the value is much higher, I want to make sure I have it in a safe and secure wallet until I purchase a hardware wallet. I am happy with Green but do not like Exodus.

And no, I don't believe it's Robinhood at all.  The purchasing history makes zero sense unless they're padding a predeveloped pool of dogecoin.  Which... Then yeah. Could totally be robinhood.  

But if that's the case, and it's a predeveloped pool of funds, then absolutely none of the transactions and activity happening on robinhood would be affecting the global market of coin cost.  The transactions wouldn't be hitting the overall transaction history of the coin. 

So nah. I don't think it's Robinhood at all. Personally I think robinhood is spread out over several wallets to hide their activities better.","Hey 36bil Whale, can you dump a little now please?"

n5nbcv,Unhappy-Grapefruit88,2021-05-05 18:45:14,dogecoin,"Investing has an impact on your tax return, and for some tax situations, capital gains might disqualify you from certain credits. This is not advice, do your own research and consult a professional or reach out to [your local VITA site](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/free-tax-return-preparation-for-qualifying-taxpayers). 

[From the IRS website](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc409):

 **Short-Term or Long-Term**

To correctly arrive at your net capital gain or loss, capital gains and losses are classified as long-term or short-term. Generally, if you hold the asset for more than one year before you dispose of it, your capital gain or loss is long-term. If you hold it one year or less, your capital gain or loss is short-term. For exceptions to this rule, such as property acquired by gift, property acquired from a decedent, or patent property, refer to [Publication 544, Sales and Other Dispositions of Assets](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p544); or for commodity futures, see [Publication 550, Investment Income and Expenses](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-publication-550).

 **Capital Gain Tax Rates**

The tax rate on most net capital gain is no higher than **15%** for most individuals. Some or all net capital gain may be taxed at 0% if your taxable income is less than $80,000.

A capital gain rate of **15%** applies if your taxable income is $80,000 or more but less than $441,450 for single; $496,600 for married filing jointly or qualifying widow(er); $469,050 for the head of household, or $248,300 for married filing separately.

However, a net capital gain tax rate of **20%** applies to the extent that your taxable income exceeds the thresholds set for the **15%** capital gain rate.

**Earned Income Tax Credit**

**Warning,** if you are eligible to claim the [earned income tax credit](https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/individuals/earned-income-tax-credit/earned-income-and-earned-income-tax-credit-eitc-tables#EITC%20Tables), which can be worth as much as $6,728 for a household of 3 or more qualifying children. Make sure your investment income is less than $3,650 or less, otherwise you may be disqualified from earning this credit and you might end up with a refund amount that is lower than your gains from Dogecoin.",Tax implications to consider when deciding to invest in Doge and/or take gains.

n5nmh5,DepressedBlackDude,2021-05-05 18:58:51,dogecoin,[removed],I‚Äôm looking to transfer crypto from my Coinbase app to Kraken it so I can buy Dogecoin. What is a cheap way to do that with out the high transfer fees ?
n5nn77,cheimbro,2021-05-05 18:59:43,dogecoin,"I can't believe people don't trust in Elon Musk. Clues have been put out for literal months. Is this guy really going to put his reputation on the line? For change to happen, you have to do this stuff. I seen comments saying the whole Doge movement is ""embarrassing"". Go watch Elon interviews, the guy doesn't give up and I truly believe is going to send Doge to the milky way. Forget the moon.

Next, how is it embarassing? Doge has literally done more for the crypto space than any other coin. Most mentions on Twitter, Business are accepting it daily. They are marketing with it every single day. It sounds like a personal issue if you find it embarrassing. People who get into Doge are getting into other coins. This will bring your alt coin with ""great"" teams money. Ha, so much for decentralization, which Doge is 100%.  

Is it hard to accept the fact that all alternate coins are carbon copies of Bitcoin with different utility? Just because the face of the coin is a Shiba Inu derived from an Internet meme does not mean it's utility is bad. I don't have to sit here and talk all the facts because there are tons of YouTubers and folks on Twitter talking about it. Educate yourself before you start spewing emotional garbage instead of real FACTS. It's also not unlimited supply. Maybe with unlimited time there is unlimited supply, but each year there is 5 billion introduced. 

I'm so sick and tired of these randoms talking literally nonsense. There's billionaries and celebrities joining in, this is probably a good sign.

Regardless, I'm not selling and holding. Much love shibes.",People are still doubting...

n5nuwk,Dippy_Dipshizzle,2021-05-05 19:08:25,dogecoin,"Other than its blockchain, Bitcoin offers nothing in particular. Using the same amount of energy as Denmark, one might even say that it represents the opposite of value. Fortunately, the unprecedented price escalation has post-rationalised its role, now being a store of value. Moreover. Bitcoin has managed to firmly implant the crypto seed in the mind of the general public. As far as I am concerned that was its job. Thank you Bitcoin, and goodbye!

Looking ahead, I find that speculating on the further price appreciation of this sensational coin is rather boring. Yes, it will appreciate further but hardly anyone will argue that its rate of appreciation will look anything like in the past. How many more trillions of dollars can it be worth? This is furthermore offset by some non-negligible risks.

First, as more professional investors enter this space, it will not take long for them to find out about better projects and switch. Already we can see Ethereum, arguably the second most famous token, outperforming Bitcoin (up 350% since January 1st vs Bitcoin's 100%). There are even better projects out there than Ethereum, and they in turn will outperform even more. One might argue that the high price of Bitcoin currently merely reflects the initial lack of knowledge of the new market entrants.

The other risk, of course, is that as Bitcoin has become more important, its geo-political aspects can no longer be ignored. In recent years, up to 70% of all Bitcoin mining activity has come from China. When 51% are enough to decide the fate of your store of value, you would want to make sure that decentralisation includes geographical decentralisation, as well. Who would want their store of value to get caught up in asymmetric warfare between the two largest economic powers?

It is not my intention to write an essay on the best tokens out there. As they say, do your own research. You need to be convinced enough of the value of your token in order to navigate the highly volatile environment. In other words, you must still believe in your token when it's 70% down from where you bought it! They do exist, in my opinion. You just need to spend plenty of time researching them.

I am rather writing with the intention of arguing against the prevailing truism that Dogecoin is a joke. This is best done when contrasting it with Bitcoin in three steps. First, we have 21 million Bitcoins against just under 130 billion Dogecoins. This is probably a good thing because no normal person can possibly have a clue as to what the Bitcoin price of a packet of chewing gum would be: way too many decimals. Yes, there are Satoshis but the name recognition applies to Bitcoin. Clearly, no normal person would expect Dogecoin to trade at $60,000 as this would put the total capitalisation at $7.8 quadrillion. But if we consider Bitcoin's current capitalisation of $1.25 trillion, who is to say that no other token can achieve this, if people believed them to be of equal use? That would put Dogecoin at just under $10. And who is to say that $1.25 trillion is a fixed cap?

Second, we have a fixed amount of Bitcoin against a steadily increasing supply of Dogecoins, 5.2 billion/year to be precise. At the current level of supply that represents an inflation rate of roughly 4%. In 20 years that inflation rate would reduce to 2.26%. As a payments system, a certain amount of inflation is actually quite welcome, some would argue, to accommodate economic growth. Milton Freedman, anyone? Suffice it to say that what actually matters, is that the supply situation cannot arbitrarily be changed. The rest is just maths.

Third, Bitcoin has the brand name and by now is recognised by the general public. But the way I see it, Bitcoin from here on cannot gain much more recognition. As other tokens get recognised more, I believe we will see more switching out of Bitcoin into the newly understood tokens; Ethereum is just the beginning. Dogecoin, on the other hand, is competing on a totally different level. It doesn't matter that its strongest point was/is being a meme. What matters is that there are more people watching/studying/owning Dogecoin than any other token out there (thank you Elon). If we get to a point where enough consumers adopt Dogecoin and enough retailers accept Dogecoin, then who is to say that DOGE will not become at least one of the future payment systems? What would its capitalisation be then? Certainly more than $1.25 trillion, and $10 DOGE may even become the floor!

To conclude, if you say Dogecoin is a joke, then surely Bitcoin must be one, too. At $60,000 that would be difficult to say, wouldn't it? But if DOGE ends up trading at $10 or even $30, then would you still call it a joke? 

Disclaimer: I have not studied the security aspect of Dogecoin, rather relying on the good folks at Litecoin. If security is an issue, then please ignore anything Dogecoin related above. :-)","Bitcoin has managed to firmly implant the crypto seed in the mind of the general public. As far as I am concerned that was its job. Thank you Bitcoin, and goodbye! Hello Dogecoin?"

n5o4kn,jh830186,2021-05-05 19:19:49,dogecoin,"**What's the market cap of the dollar, euro and renmibi?**

You don't analyze currencies based on market cap. It's just a relative, pair value. You can't buy AAPL with MSFT, but you can buy USD with DOGE and DOGE with USD. This is not a stock.

&amp;#x200B;

 I don't know why this is so hard to get. EVERY currency is a vehicle for trade, and they're all based on trust. That's the whole point. State backed currencies change their relative, pair value depending on the economy of their countries by the effect of central banks. 

&amp;#x200B;

DOGE is potentially a worldwide currency, only at its very first stages. Unlike Bitcoin, which is useful for value storage, or ETH, which has alternative applications like creating contracts, NFT and so on, the only use DOGE has is as an everyday currency. And as any of those, ITS VALUE IS JUST BASED ON TRUST. 

&amp;#x200B;

Good thing is it's more advanced than any traditional currency, because it doesn't need banks and you can pay virtually instantly everywhere. And not being capped is the other great thing, because it provides an unlimited incentive for miners to keep going on without paying huge fees (unlike BTC, which will be slow and expensive as hell once we're near or reach its cap).

&amp;#x200B;

As long as people believe in DOGE's future and there are Dollars, Euros... out there, its pair value will keep going up.

&amp;#x200B;

HODL.","STOP talking about market cap, makes no sense!"

1-  Robinhood began trading dogecoin before that wallet ever existed. 
2- The wallet creation date is about 5 months after Elon Musk and creator of dogecoin had a public exchange on Twitter. About crypto. 
3- DH5 moved a large amount of coin out recently. Just like Tesla did as a proof of liquidity. 


It would be nice if during the monologue musk announces you can buy a Tesla with doge and he is the largest holder. Maybe he even burns his coins. Which is 25% of all coin. 

I just wanted to put my prediction here.",Elon Musk Owns the largest wallet not robinhood. DH5 wallet creation date doesn‚Äôt match the robinhood doge trading date.

People are claiming there will be a crash that causes regular people to lose all their money. Is there any truth to that or are they simply upset that they can no longer play gatekeeper and control the market?

Is this real? Is the bubble going to burst at $1? If 90% of Doge is held by 3 or 4 people they could, mathematically, crash Doge by selling all of their positions, but will they? Should we be tempering our expectations?

With that said, I can afford to lose my $8,000 investment, but I certainly don't want to.",Is a doge crash a real thing or fake? Is the $1 bubble going to burst.

When I register, I'm happy to use a referral code to get a fellow Shibe and myself a bonus or free coin. So, FCFS, post a code for Binance, Mercari, OKcoin, Webull, or bitpay and when I register, I will use your code to help us both out.

And also still buy every dip, even with new floors. I'm all in. Crazy or good idea? Still a crypto noob but earning and holding and have made enough now to get serious with ownership of my profits. Ultimate plan is a RH extraction if they don't wallet up soon. I will leave HODL doge there for straight up investment for profit. But I want to use this equity for stuff we need now. I want to be able to spend a percentage of the damn doge for both our family and doge's value. Also open to other exchange/wallet suggestions that people like for purchase actions. I still have no CLUE what the different types of wallets mean.

There will be smaller dips at least, maybe even a bigger one. Instead of panicking you buy the dip. ""OH easy to say if you have money"". Well, this is where Dollar Cost Averaging comes in. If you have 500$ to invest in dogecoin (money you can afford to loose is the key here no matter the price), you don't put in 500$ at once. Instead you put 50 or 100, and when it dips you put in another 100, and if it dips more buy with 200. The idea is to lower your average buyin cost, while enjoying dips Instead of dreading them.

This makes Doge attractive and attainable for anyone to buy full coins and be a part of the movement and growth. This terrifies whales, and thrills people like me. I think when more people learn about Doge it will grow even more, and when it hits $1 it will be only the beginning for most investors/coin-owners.

Remember, people who first bought at $.04 like me, or earlier, make up a shrinking percentage of coin hodlers. As it grows, the expectation for returns will grow with it. $1.00 buyers will be hoping for $2 etc‚Ä¶",Doge is unstoppable because it‚Äôs cheap

2) If anyone says you should sell, immediately unfriend them and cut all contact - you don‚Äôt need that negativity in your life.

3) Always say to your friends ‚Äúit‚Äôs going up.‚Äù That way your friends will buy it and the more people who buy it the more it will go up. Plus, you and your friends will have loads of doge.

4) Learn bio-chemistry to genetically modify your hands into 24 carat diamonds.

This is what you need to hear:

1) Doge will dip at $1 probably by a significant amount

2) This dip will most likely rebound within a week on another big announcement like we have seen (new businesses adding it as a payment option)

3) if you need money sell

4) you will have to wait a year from now to really see MASSIVE gains

5) the only question is can you live with yourself if you sell now and it‚Äôs worth $25 a share a year from now?

I been doing my research watching videos reading threads about the pros and cons about Doge and pretty much a lot of the devils advocates are saying it‚Äôs not stable it‚Äôs a pump and dump meme. It could have potential but unlike Ethereum which is doing great and becoming stable there just NOBODY working on the coin itself to become stable. The only thing Doge is doing and have going for it is the Hype. Is there ACTUALLY DEVELOPERS working on this coin? Working on its system and coding and whatever technical stuff to actually make this coin stable and a real threat to being a stable useful currency?

Dogecoin started its initial coin production schedule with 100 [billion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion) coins in circulation. By mid-2015 the 100 billionth Dogecoin had been mined with an additional 5 [billion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion) coins put into circulation every year thereafter. Although there is no theoretical supply limit, at this rate, the number of dogecoins put into circulation will only double in 26 years. There is no implemented hard cap on the total supply of Dogecoins. Initially, Dogecoin had a supply limit of 100 billion coins, which would have been far more coins than the top digital currencies were then allowing. Nonetheless, in February 2014, Dogecoin founder Jackson Palmer announced that the limit would be removed in an effort to create a consistent reduction of its inflation rate over time.[\[41\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogecoin#cite_note-41)",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogecoin

Basically, I am not depending on Elon or big investors for Dogecoin to fly past Mars.  It is also not just from buying and hodling from us regular non-whale diamond hands.

I am depending on retailers to accept it as a viable currency.  I am depending on more platforms to accept it as a crypto to buy/sell/trade (Coinbase for example).  I am depending on more platforms to have wallets available for our coin we bought through them (Robinhood, for example.  And I know that we don't own the coin there yet, but when they provide a wallet, we will own all that coin).

What can we do to campaign to retailers to accept payments using Dogecoin?  To get Coinbase and other crypto markets to accept it?  To get Robinhood and Webull and other investment firms to give us wallets and ownership of our coins through them?

Sure I hear about Amazon thinking about it, but have we asked Target, Costco, eBay, etc., what they think about it?  Or messaged them to suggest or demand it?  We can think bigger if we want to be bigger.  We can make campaigns to rally to these places and demand change and acceptance of the future of currency.

1. Can't be Robinhood or another exchange. This wallet has been making a few small purchases daily sometimes skipping days at a time while exchanges process millions of trades at a time. 

2. Does not sell until major percentage changes over x amount of time.

3. Strong possibilty of it being a private group of individuals that use this address as a way to store massive amounts over time. Then, when they unanimously decide to sell they activate the trade through programming. It then divvies up the profits to each individual based on their input.

4. a wallet that collects Dogecoin from a miner and millionaire buyer that has been doing so for years.

Looking at all of their transactions they were a millionaire long before Dogecoin, consistent buys in the millions of Dogecoin for days in a row throughout 2019-2021 even still they are buying more, they are the reason the price was pumped to 0.07 after that though its all been the lower wallets.

This whale respects Dogecoin and what it stands for, this is why they only sell 100,000,000 dogecoin at a time instead of 10,000,000,000 at a time. They are not in it for the crazy gains, they see the pottential, and they would be crazy to sell instead of let doge rise and have wealth for generations.",This is my stance on the #1 wallet feel free to make it an open discussion.

I'm holding.

Not because of the coin; because of the community that has grown around the coin. I knew about Dogecoin very shortly after it's creation. For many it was a fun pastime and, over time, this community and other, smaller communities, grew around it. As someone who supports and helps those with disabilities learn skills and gain independence I did not have a lot to invest. That's the funny thing about passion, it rarely pays a lot. Yet I did because of that community.

825 Coins, that is the best I can do. My old wallet is gone, lost in the great College experience. In many ways I see this as another Reddit social experiment, so similar to a certain ""Place"" back in 2017. I don't hold for the coin, or for profit though that'd be great, I do so for the positive and sometimes ridiculous community. I've lurked for a long time, so it is honestly really awesome to see things suddenly take off.

Share the wealth too! With those with few coins, who only have a few dollars to invest. Just because Dogecoin is gaining value doesn't mean we can't keep right on doing what the community has always done.

\- Time when ""Dogecoin"" is first mentioned

\- Time when ""Dogecoin"" is last mentioned

\- Number of times Rockets are pictured (including SpaceX rockets)

\-  How many Shiba Inus will be in the episode?

So, I ordered a two-pack of actual Dogecoins off Amazon, but only after ordering it did I realize that it would take three weeks. But I wanted it now, so I ordered one off eBay. I forgot to cancel the Amazon order, which arrived today. So now I have two gold and one silver Doge. I can't decide if I want to keep the gold or silver one, but I definitely don't need two gold ones.

I was planning to sell it for Doge, but thanks to a kind shibe who too time out of his day to help me recover a wallet (unsuccessfully (don't transfer most of your Doge to a phone app and then lose the phone. LFMF!)) and refused any compensation, I've decided to give it away instead. It looks like [this one](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51udBoQSMsL._AC_UL320_.jpg) and comes in a plastic case.

Rules:  
1. You must live (or have access to a mailbox) in a part of the world that a person in the US can legally send mail to. Sorry Iran, DPRK, the Disputed Zone, R'lyeh, etc. If I'm able to, I will get a tracking number when I ship it, but if you don't live in the US, that might be harder. If you're worried about privacy, I'll send it to whatever name and address you ask me to: PO Box, friend's house, all those are fine.  
2. You must not already have one. I obviously have no way to verify this so we're on the honor system here. That includes other Doge coin variants. If you have other crypto coins that doesn't disqualify you. This will look fine next to your Bitcoin and Ethereum coins.
3. I will take upvotes into consideration as to what the community likes best, but ultimately, I will pick the winner and my decision, when announced, will be final.

in 2017 I thought cryptocurrency is cool and bought some coins here and there. Dogecoin looked funny and since I liked the Memes I invested 50‚Ç¨ and after my crypto-mining-expert-friends laughed at me for this stupid investment I forgot about it completely.

A couple of days ago a coworker talked to me about how the currency grew about 1500% and that he thought he was too late to profit from the hype. I hadn't heard from it at all since I was really busy lately. Back at home I tried opening Multidoge on my old 2012 Macbook hoping I would have saved the password somewhere or maybe even hadn't given it a password at all. Unfortunately Multidoge wouldn't even open, since I had Java 8 but needed Java 6.

After some fails trying to downgrade my Java-Version I opened my wifes' even older Macbook since I knew she never installs any updates and crossed my fingers after downloading and installing Multidoge. It opened and I transferred my wallet files from my Device and imported them on hers.

Now I am very close to my goal but the wallet doesn't stop syncing. Did I do something wrong or forgot a step? Does anyone have any idea on how to finish the synchronistation?",Help I can't recover Multidoge

n5szng,Vedorias,2021-05-05 22:54:10,dogecoin,"Hey y'all, just a random thought regarding leverage.

**tldr; Using leverage is super dangerous and this would totally blow up in your face, don't do this.**

You may know what leverage is and how it works, but what many people may not be aware of is how insanely quickly it multiplies your gains.

Let's imagine DOGE goes to $4. If you hold 1000 coins and you bought in at $0.5, you will have turned $500 into $4000, for a nice 700% return on investment.

Let's run the same example, except this time using leverage of 3x. 

Now, you may think that you'd triple your profits, and end up with around 2300% returns, or about 11.5k, thereabouts. You would be **very wrong**. At least, if you make sure to compound your gains and reinvest it. By doing so, you double your money for every 33% that the coin goes up. and the next time, you double **that** money as well, and so on.

I'm sure most of you are thinking ""well, duh, that's just like how interest works on a savings account"", and you're right. Except the numbers work very differently when instead of 3% annual returns, you're talking about 800% annual returns.

If, for example, you make sure to reinvest every time the asset rises by $0.10, you won't end up with 12k.... you'll end up with **881k**.

An example of what happens, if we reinvest our profits at every $0.1 price increment:

[profit at each stage = coins \* \(price\_T - price\_T-1\) \* leverage](https://preview.redd.it/a7gz2kitpdx61.png?width=388&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ec0ae135ee397976901978b1415ee948a7714fc)

Of course the downside is that a **33% dip at any point will wipe you out completely** :) - and we came kinda close to that just today, so this might not be the best strategy to follow. But if you truly want to YOLO it...

*(I may or may not be holding 8000 coins at 3x leverage right now...)*",The insane power of leverage

Seen so many of the same posts... 
Was time to write something that can be easily understood by the people just starting with crypto.  
Keeping the wording simple and accessible.

&amp;nbsp;

This guide tries to explain some of the frequently asked questions about wallets, explains why backups are important. 

&amp;nbsp;

Writing a guide like this takes time and effort; tips are appreciated.  
My Dogecoin address is `D6cj1cFnt3zh3CBtSh51wWFruGBMKD6F8E`.



&amp;nbsp;  

# What is the Dogecoin blockchain?

The Dogecoin blockchain is where all the Dogecoin transactions are stored. All the transactions since the creation of Dogecoin. The blockchain is public, you can for example use the Dogecoin blockchain explorer on https://dogechain.info to search transactions and addresses. 

&amp;nbsp; 

# What is a wallet?

A wallet is just a piece of software that stores your private keys. A private key gives access to a public address. A private key proves that you are the owner of an address, and makes it possible to access the DOGEs on that address.

All the wallet software (like Dogecoin Core, MultiDoge, the mobile apps) read your private keys, and using the blockchain know which addresses are yours and what the DOGE balance is.

&amp;nbsp; 

# Private keys? Public addresses? What?!

Public addresses are the DOGE addresses that are public (visible on the blockchain). These are the addresses that you use to send DOGE to and receive DOGE on. These addresses start with a `D`, for example: `DTxM2ukZKNeSK6FWoW2vNYcookcsXkJ788`. 

&amp;nbsp;

Every public address had a private key. This key is the secret key. With this key, you gain access to the public address and the balance on it. The private key proves that you are the owner of the address. 
Private keys start with a `Q`, for example: `QUp5pdBLaQNQeqPhtEquiKGJAPAAzixC2GyAKUMv75v2BVBKRidQ`.

&amp;nbsp;

Private keys are important: if you have a private key, you have access to the DOGE on the public address that is linked to the private key. Do not share a private key with others.

&amp;nbsp; 

# BACKUP, BACKUP, BACKUP

You need one of these to access DOGE on an address:
 
- **Private key**
  - Random letters and numbers, starting with a `Q`.
  - 1 private key per public address.   
&amp;nbsp;    
- **Wallet file**  
  - Can be a `wallet.dat` (Dogecoin Core) file or a `multidoge.wallet` file (MultiDoge).
  - Can contain many public addresses, all in 1 file.
  - Also contains the private keys for the addresses.
    - Private keys can be extracted from a wallet file.  
&amp;nbsp;  
- **Mnemonic phrase, seed phrase, recovery phrase** 
  - 12/15/18/21/24 English words  
    - Example: `viable turn gospel jaguar average enter shrug shallow gesture digital must enact`.
  - Contains many public addresses (and thus the private keys).
  - Used by hardware wallets (like Ledger and Trezor), and mobile wallets (Coinomi, Trust Wallet etc.).
  
&amp;nbsp;  

Do not share your private keys, wallet files and recovery phrases with others!

&amp;nbsp; 

If you have a backup of your private keys or wallet file or recovery phrase, you can always restore your DOGEs. So, the first thing you do when you create a new wallet, is to backup! Keep making regular backups, especially after sending DOGE.

&amp;nbsp;

# When to use an exchange as a wallet?!

When you trade frequently. Buy, sell, buy, sell. When you do that, go ahead and store your DOGEs on an exchange.  

&amp;nbsp;

Exchanges don't give you access to the private keys... You don't own the coins. An exchange allows you to have access to the coins, but they can revoke your access. When they do that, there is no way to access the DOGEs. Why? You don't have the private keys. 

&amp;nbsp;

Also, exchanges can go offline. In that case, you also lose all your coins on that exchange. Why? You don't have the private keys. 


&amp;nbsp;

So, when using exchanges, only store the amount of DOGE you are willing to trade with. Just remember: with exchanges, there is always the possibility of losing access to the coins at any moment.
 

&amp;nbsp;

A few examples of exchanges: Binance, Bittrex, Kraken, Robinhood

# When not to use an exchange as a wallet?!

When you do not want to trade.  
When you want to HODL for the long term.  
When you want total control of your coins.  

&amp;nbsp;  

Absolutely not recommended to use to store all your DOGEs.

&amp;nbsp;  


# After all that, any recommendations for a wallet?

- Dogecoin Core and MultiDoge

Safest to use (MAKE PROPER BACKUPS, and encrypt the wallet!!!). 
Wallets that have a wallet file **and** give you the private keys. 

&amp;nbsp;  

Not recommended for beginners. It's cumbersome to use, as you need to download/sync the blockchain, which can take a loooong time. 

&amp;nbsp;  

- DogeChain.info 

Easy to use. 
Safe when proper measures are taken (enable two-factor authentication!).
MAKE BACKUPS!!!

&amp;nbsp;

I recommend this to people who want to access their coins quickly, to easily make transactions.  
Can recommend this to recover DOGEs when you have the private key!

&amp;nbsp;

I would normally also recommend this to beginners, but I have seen so many users losing access to their wallets, because they don't store their login details. Or forget to backup their 2FA properly. 
If proper backups are made, everything can be restored quickly. But people just don't backup and lose access to the coins.

&amp;nbsp; 

- **Hardware wallets***

**For beginners and everybody else who is serious in storing DOGE for the long term, this is what I absolutely recommend.**  

You only need to store a recovery phrase (Ledger: 24 words; Trezor: 12/24 words), so if you can store those words somewhere save, you can always restore your wallet! 

&amp;nbsp;

If you want to buy a Ledger, I would appreciate it if you would use my affiliate link (I will earn a small amount of money). Let me know if you would like to do that. Also, check out /r/ledgerwallet, you can find discount codes there frequently.

&amp;nbsp;

- Mobile wallets that give the recovery phrase!

Mobile wallets like Coinomi and Trust Wallet share the recovery phrase of a wallet. With the recovery phrase, you can always recover the DOGEs, even without the mobile wallet itself. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, every mobile wallet that gives you control over the coin is OK to use.  
This is a beginner-friendly option!

&amp;nbsp;

While the Android app Dogecoin Wallet support backups and restores, you do NOT get a recovery phrase. Not recommended because of this. (There are ways to extract the recovery phrase from a backup, but it's built-in, so not for everybody.)

&amp;nbsp;

# TL;DR

- Make backups. Make sure you have a backup. Make a backup of your backup.

- Recommended wallets for beginners and for long term storage: hardware wallets like Ledger and Trezor. And mobile apps like Coinomi and Trust Wallet.

- Not recommended: storing all your DOGEs on an exchange. 

&amp;nbsp;

That's all for now.","[Guide] Explanation of wallets, why backups are important, what to pay attention to, my recommendations for wallets. Meant for beginners!"

I'm investing $ 500 in Ethereum. This may increase. times to $ 50,000. Makes a profit of 1400 percent.

Profit = $ 7,000.

Dogecoin is a memecoin and it predictably spread like one too, it's super popular now. Would it *really* be this easy for so many people to make so much money? 

My theory is that with Elon Musk hosting SNL on the 8th, everyone expects the price to go up and stay up, but it'll drop after it rises because all the whales will cash in, tanking the price forever while a) they profit and b) we all lose our money?

Until Doge, I was hesitant about Crypto as it was unconventional and difficult to value comparatively to other investments. It was a risky, scary prospect to me. However, Doge opened me up to a whole new world of opportunity and how I now look at things; more importantly, it brightens my day reading how well everyone is doing here.

Some people just like memes. Whether you bought in at .002 or at 1.25, the purpose for crypto remains the same. The price is irrelevant in regards to utility. 

I have a lot of Doge. I got it cheap. I get it, I lucked out and not everyone is there.  But the way I see it. That has just become a new emergency. I'd like to see Dogecoin massively adopted by the world. I want to buy coffee with Doge. I want to buy gas with Doge. I want to see a movie at AMC with a girlfriend that I'll never acquire. But I'm gonna see that movie paying with Doge. 

How do we get there? It's a long road, but you still need to start down a path to get somewhere. We continue to encourage and ask businesses if they accept Doge. And if not, when? If they don't know, encourage that 17 year old to pass it up through the COC. If it happened, then even if Doge hits $75, I will buy more Doge. I'll buy it, so that I can use it. Am I selling it? No. I don't want the dollar. Will I sell it if I need the money? What on earth could I possibly NEED that my job doesn't pay me for? Not making any money? Why are you investing into Dogecoin before you can use it?

When I hire people, they'll each get the opportunity to get paid in crypto. ""Can you pay me in Safemoon?"", ""Did I hire you?"" ""Yes."" ""Well, you're fired.""

On a real note, this future where crypto is actually used daily for almost all transactions isn't too unrealistic. Its possible. And it will creep up before you know it.

My ""not advice"" is to buy some of the cool stuff with the cash you would be spending on new shoes or that $6 espresso flavored cup of sugar and continue to do that... and then just keep doing that. Doge isn't going anywhere. Ethereum isn't going anywhere. Bitcoin isn't go.... Dogecoin isn't going anywhere. Please keep up the memes. Turn them into NFTs if you're keen. But stop trading our precious coin for useful money that can be printed randomly and likely unaccounted for. We have a constant and steady flow of new Doge every year that can keep this stable. Let's be the men and women that we hope to see in the future.

But what do I know...",Holding Doge till death do us part

I've developed a REGRET-PROOF, LOSS-PROOF methodology for small-coin investing (safemoon, bonfire, $happy coin, etc...)

It is simply well-worded, carefully thought-out written directions to take anyone from noob-moderate-experienced levels through a SAFE method of investing in these new coins.

It is the one I use myself.

This is for those that want to maximize profits, avoid losses, stave off regret, and feel confident knowing they have always made the best possible decision when it comes to small-coin investing.

WHICH coins you invest in is up to you, although ofcourse i can share which I currently have stake in, or find interesting.

This is simply a method you can employ once you have found a coin that interests you, and you want to invest in it, in the smartest way possible.

For anyone interested, I will be offering this quick text-guide BY DONATION. 

This means that it is FREE if you want it to be. However, if you appreciate the advice, I would greatly appreciate a donation of ANY amount of coin to my wallet. :)
 I will accept most any coin as a donation! This saves you from the fees of converting back to bnb if you only have small-coins.

Throw me a message on reddit, or a comment on this post with an upvote, to let me know you're interested.

Thanks so much for reading, and best of luck on your crazy crypto adventure.
